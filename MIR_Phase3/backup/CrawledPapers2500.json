[{"id": "3105081694", "title": "COVID-Net: a tailored deep convolutional neural network design for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images.", "abstract": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of the global population. A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography. It was found in early studies that patients present abnormalities in chest radiography images that are characteristic of those infected with COVID-19. Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research community, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases, with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most.", "date": "2020", "authors": ["Linda Wang , Zhong Qiu Lin , Alexander Wong"], "related_topics": ["Deep learning", "Convolutional neural network", "Image processing", "Benchmark (computing)", "Machine learning", "Key (cryptography)", "Computer science", "Radiography", "Artificial intelligence", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)", "Tomography x ray computed", "X ray image"], "citation_count": "743", "reference_count": "46", "references": ["2194775991", "3001118548", "2962835968", "3008827533", "2919115771", "2108598243", "2963446712", "3007497549", "3010604545", "3008985036"]}, {"id": "3001118548", "title": "Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China", "abstract": "A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

METHODS: Clinical specimens from patients with SARS were searched for unknown viruses with the use of cell cultures and molecular techniques. RESULTS: A novel coronavirus was identified in patients with SARS. The virus was isolated in cell culture, and a sequence 300 nucleotides in length was obtained by a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-based random-amplification procedure. Genetic characterization indicated that the virus is only distantly related to known coronaviruses (identical in 50 to 60 percent of the nucleotide sequence). On the basis of the obtained sequence, conventional and real-time PCR assays for specific and sensitive detection of the novel virus were established. Virus was detected in a variety of clinical specimens from patients with SARS but not in controls. High concentrations of viral RNA of up to 100 million molecules per milliliter were found in sputum. Viral RNA was also detected at extremely low concentrations in plasma during the acute phase and in feces during the late convalescent phase.

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1.

No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we report the discovery of a novel small molecule GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue, with antiviral activity against EBOV. GS-5734 exhibits antiviral activity against multiple variants of EBOV and other filoviruses in cell-based assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734 in vitro, and the NTP acts as an alternative substrate and RNA-chain terminator in primer-extension assays using a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent NTP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (half-life, 14\u2009h) and distribution to sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eyes, and brain. In a rhesus monkey model of EVD, once-daily intravenous administration of 10\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in two out of six treated animals. These results show the first substantive post-exposure protection by a small-molecule antiviral compound against EBOV in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 in vitro against other pathogenic RNA viruses, including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses, suggests the potential for wider medical use.

In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization.

Use of a single exonuclease hydrolysis probe or two adjacent hybridization probes offers increasing levels of specificity. In contrast to fluorescence measurement once per cycle, continuous monitoring throughout each cycle monitors the temperature dependence of fluorescence. The cumulative, irreversible signal of hydrolysis probes can be distinguished easily from the temperature-dependent, reversible signal of hybridization probes. By using SYBR Green I, product denaturation, annealing and extension can be followed within each cycle.

To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters.

We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked. Findings Patients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild. Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease. A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients. By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation.

It has been generally thought that this process is driven by interactions between the viral transmembrane proteins and the internal virion components (core, capsid, or nucleocapsid). This model was particularly applicable to alphaviruses, which require both spike proteins and a nucleocapsid for budding. However, genetic studies have clearly shown that the retrovirus core protein, i.e., the Gag protein, is able to form enveloped particles by itself. Also, budding of negative-strand RNA viruses (rhabdoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses) seems to be accomplished mainly by internal components, most probably the matrix protein, since the spike proteins are not absolutely required for budding of these viruses either. In contrast, budding of coronavirus particles can occur in the absence of the nucleocapsid and appears to require two membrane proteins only. Biochemical and structural data suggest that the proteins, which play a key role in budding, drive this process by forming a three-dimensional (cage-like) protein lattice at the surface of or within the membrane. Similarly, recent electron microscopic studies revealed that the alphavirus spike proteins are also engaged in extensive lateral interactions, forming a dense protein shell at the outer surface of the viral envelope. On the basis of these data, we propose that the budding of enveloped viruses in general is governed by lateral interactions between peripheral or integral membrane proteins.

Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively.", "date": "2011", "authors": ["G.

To understand the molecular mechanisms that govern this function, we characterized apoptosis in cardiac muscle cells following serum deprivation. Cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1), a potent cardiac survival factor (Sheng, Z., Pennica, D., Wood, W. I., and Chien, K. R. (1996) Development (Camb.) 122, 419-428), is capable of inhibiting apoptosis in cardiac myocytes. To explore the potential downstream pathways that might be responsible for this effect, we documented that CT-1 activated both signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)- and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent pathways. The transfection of a MAP kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) dominant negative mutant cDNA into myocardial cells blocked the antiapoptotic effects of CT-1, indicating a requirement of the MAP kinase pathway for the survival effect of CT-1. A MEK-specific inhibitor (PD098059) (Dudley, D. T., Pang, L., Decker, S.-J., Bridges, A. J., and Saltiel, A. R. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In contrast, this inhibitor did not block the activation of STAT3, nor did it have any effect on the hypertrophic response elicited following stimulation of CT-1. Therefore, CT-1 promotes cardiac myocyte survival via the activation of an antiapoptotic signaling pathway that requires MAP kinases, whereas the hypertrophy induced by CT-1 may be mediated by alternative pathways, e.g. Janus kinase/STAT or MEK kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase.", "date": "1997", "authors": ["Zelin Sheng 1, Kirk Knowlton 2, Ju Chen 1, Masahiko Hoshijima 1, Joan Heller Brown 3, Kenneth R.

METHODS: Nationwide case series of 2135 pediatric patients with COVID-19 reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from January 16, 2020, to February 8, 2020, were included. The epidemic curves were constructed by key dates of disease onset and case diagnosis. Onset-to-diagnosis curves were constructed by fitting a log-normal distribution to data on both onset and diagnosis dates. RESULTS: There were 728 (34.1%) laboratory-confirmed cases and 1407 (65.9%) suspected cases. The median age of all patients was 7 years (interquartile range: 2\u201313 years), and 1208 case patients (56.6%) were boys. More than 90% of all patients had asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases. The median time from illness onset to diagnoses was 2 days (range: 0\u201342 days). There was a rapid increase of disease at the early stage of the epidemic, and then there was a gradual and steady decrease. The disease rapidly spread from Hubei province to surrounding provinces over time. More children were infected in Hubei province than any other province. CONCLUSIONS: Children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19, and there was no significant sex difference.

However, atomic details at the binding interface demonstrate that key residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2-CTD slightly strengthen the interaction and lead to higher affinity for receptor binding than SARS-RBD. Additionally, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against SARS-CoV-S1/receptor-binding domain (RBD) were unable to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating notable differences in antigenicity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. They include Appearing in Proceedings of the 13 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2010, Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy. Volume 9 of JMLR: WC Weston et al., 2008). Much attention has recently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a review), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language processing (NLP) (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mnih & Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Bengio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep architecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Why are these new algorithms working so much better than the standard random initialization and gradient-based optimization of a supervised training criterion? Part of the answer may be found in recent analyses of the effect of unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2009), showing that it acts as a regularizer that initializes the parameters in a \u201cbetter\u201d basin of attraction of the optimization procedure, corresponding to an apparent local minimum associated with better generalization. But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise procedure would give better results. So here instead of focusing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multilayer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to monitor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of activation function (with the idea that it might affect saturation) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pretraining is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact).", "date": "2010", "authors": ["Xavier Glorot , Yoshua Bengio"], "related_topics": ["Deep learning", "Vanishing gradient problem", "Initialization"], "citation_count": "13,013", "reference_count": "17", "references": ["2136922672", "2310919327", "2072128103", "2117130368", "2025768430", "2110798204", "1498436455", "1994197834", "2131462252", "2172174689"]}, {"id": "2581275558", "title": "Optimization by simulated annealing", "abstract": "There is a deep and useful connection between statistical mechanics (the behavior of systems with many degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium at a finite temperature) and multivariate or combinatorial optimization (finding the minimum of a given function depending on many parameters).

In this work, we equip the networks with another pooling strategy, \u201cspatial pyramid pooling\u201d, to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. Pyramid pooling is also robust to object deformations.

On the ImageNet 2012 dataset, we demonstrate that SPP-net boosts the accuracy of a variety of CNN architectures despite their different designs.

In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a \"compact\" coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal compact code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of \"sparse distributed\" coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling \"wavelet transforms\" are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems would evolve toward sparse coding are presented.", "date": "1999", "authors": ["David J.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. Methods We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. Findings The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99\u00b798% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. Interpretation 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

We have previously reported that gradient descent learning can be more effective in NARX networks than in recurrent neural network architectures that have \"hidden states\" on problems including grammatical inference and nonlinear system identification. Typically, the network converges much faster and generalizes better than other networks. The results in this paper are consistent with this phenomenon.

Phenomena of interest here are those in which an advancing nonfaceted solidification front suffers an instability and subsequently reorganizes itself into a more complex mode of behavior. The purpose of this essay is to examine several such situations and, in doing this, to identify a few new theoretical ideas and a larger number of outstanding problems. The systems studied are those in which solidification is controlled entirely by a single diffusion process, either the flow of latent heat away from a moving interface or the analogous redistribution of chemical constituents. Convective effects are ignored, as are most effects of crystalline anisotropy. The linear theory of the Mullins-Sekerka instability is reviewed for simple planar and spherical cases and also for a special model of directional solidification. These techniques are then extended to the case of a freely growing dendrite, and it is shown how this analysis leads to an understanding of sidebranching and tip-splitting instabilities. A marginal-stability hypothesis is introduced; and it is argued that this intrinsically nonlinear theory, if valid, permits aone to use results of linear-stability analysis to predict dendritic growth rates. The review concludes with a discussion of nonlinear effects in directional solidication. The nonplanar, cellular interfaces which emerge in this situation have much in common with convection patterns in hydrodynamics. The cellular stability problem is discussed briefly, and some preliminary attempts to do calculations in the strongly nonlinear regime are summarized.", "date": "1979", "authors": ["J. S.

We study what makes for good data augmentation for video self-supervised learning and find both spatial and temporal information are crucial.

High fever, viraemia and abnormalities in blood count and blood chemistry were evident in many animals before ZMapp intervention. Advanced disease, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes, mucosal haemorrhages and generalized petechia could be reversed, leading to full recovery. ELISA and neutralizing antibody assays indicate that ZMapp is cross-reactive with the Guinean variant of Ebola. ZMapp exceeds the efficacy of any other therapeutics described so far, and results warrant further development of this cocktail for clinical use. A new treatment, containing an optimized cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies against Ebola virus, provided full protection and disease reversal in rhesus monkeys when given under conditions in which controls succumbed by day 8; this new therapy may be a good candidate for treating Ebola virus infection in human patients.

These models are composed of many nonlinear computational elements operating in parallel and arranged in patterns reminiscent of biological neural nets. Computational elements or nodes are connected via weights that are typically adapted during use to improve performance. There has been a recent resurgence in the field of artificial neural nets caused by new net topologies and algorithms, analog VLSI implementation techniques, and the belief that massive parallelism is essential for high performance speech and image recognition. This paper provides an introduction to the field of artificial neural nets by reviewing six important neural net models that can be used for pattern classification. These nets are highly parallel building blocks that illustrate neural net components and design principles and can be used to construct more complex systems. In addition to describing these nets, a major emphasis is placed on exploring how some existing classification and clustering algorithms can be performed using simple neuron-like components. Single-layer nets can implement algorithms required by Gaussian maximum-likelihood classifiers and optimum minimum-error classifiers for binary patterns corrupted by noise. More generally, the decision regions required by any classification algorithm can be generated in a straightforward manner by three-layer feed-forward nets.", "date": "1988", "authors": ["Richard P.

Proteins with such motifs include RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, putative RNA helicase, chymotrypsin-like and papain-like proteases, and methyltransferases. The genes for these proteins form partially conserved modules in large subsets of viruses. A concept of the virus genome as a relatively evolutionarily stable \"core\" of housekeeping genes accompanied by a much more flexible \"shell\" consisting mostly of genes coding for virion components and various accessory proteins is discussed. Shuffling of the \"shell\" genes including genome reorganization and recombination between remote groups of viruses is considered to be one of the major factors of virus evolution. Multiple alignments for the conserved viral proteins were constructed and used to generate the respective phylogenetic trees. Based primarily on the tentative phylogeny for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is the only universally conserved protein of positive-strand RNA viruses, three large classes of viruses, each consisting of distinct smaller divisions, were delineated. A strong correlation was observed between this grouping and the tentative phylogenies for the other conserved proteins as well as the arrangement of genes encoding these proteins in the virus genome. A comparable correlation with the polymerase phylogeny was not found for genes encoding virion components or for genome expression strategies. It is surmised that several types of arrangement of the \"shell\" genes as well as basic mechanisms of expression could have evolved independently in different evolutionary lineages. The grouping revealed by phylogenetic analysis may provide the basis for revision of virus classification, and phylogenetic taxonomy of positive-strand RNA viruses is outlined. Some of the phylogenetically derived divisions of positive-strand RNA viruses also include double-stranded RNA viruses, indicating that in certain cases the type of genome nucleic acid may not be a reliable taxonomic criterion for viruses. Hypothetical evolutionary scenarios for positive-strand RNA viruses are proposed. It is hypothesized that all positive-strand RNA viruses and some related double-stranded RNA viruses could have evolved from a common ancestor virus that contained genes for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a chymotrypsin-related protease that also functioned as the capsid protein, and possibly an RNA helicase.", "date": "1992", "authors": ["Eugene V.

Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020.

Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.

Routine laboratory analytics are often unavailable in the outbreak setting, and few data exist for the associated haematological and biochemical abnormalities. We aimed to assess laboratory and clinical data from patients with Ebola virus disease to better inform clinical management algorithms, improve understanding of key variables associated with outcome, and provide insight into the pathophysiology of Ebola virus disease. Methods We recruited all patients, alive on arrival, with confirmed Ebola virus disease who were admitted to the Kerry Town Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone. At admission, all patients had clinical presentation recorded and blood taken for Ebola confirmation using reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and for haematological and biochemical analysis. We studied the association between these and clinical outcome. The primary outcome was discharge from the Ebola treatment centre. Findings 150 patients were admitted to the treatment centre between Dec 8, 2014, and Jan 9, 2015. The mean age of patients was 26 years (SD 14\u00b77). Case fatality rate was 37% (55/150). Most patients presented with stage 2 (gastrointestinal involvement, 72/118 [61%]) and stage 3 (severe or complicated, 12/118 [10%]) disease. Acute kidney injury was common (52/104 [50%]), as were abnormal serum potassium (32/97 [33%]), severe hepatitis (54/92 [59%]), and raised C-reactive protein (21/100 [21%]). Haematological abnormalities were common, including raised haematocrit (15/100 [15%]), thrombocytopenia (47/104 [45%]), and granulocytosis (44/104 [42%]). Severe acute kidney injury, low RT-PCR cycle threshold ( Interpretation Ebola virus disease is associated with a high prevalence of haematological and biochemical abnormalities, even in mild disease and in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.

Influenza A and B matrix-protein genes and the influenza C haemagglutinin gene were targets for the type-specific primers. Subtype-specific primers targeted conserved sequences within the three haemagglutinin or two neuraminidase subtypes of different human influenza isolates. The utility of this method was demonstrated using computer search methods and by accurately amplifying DNA from a variety of influenza A, B, and C strains. Type-specific primer sets showed a broad type specificity and amplified DNA from viral strains of unknown sequence. Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing showed that fragments amplified in this manner derived from the input template, confirming the accuracy of the method and demonstrating how PCR can be used to quickly derive sufficient sequence information for analysis of viral relatedness.

Scaling of a dose is required in three main situations: the anticipation of first-in-human doses for clinical trials, dose extrapolation in veterinary practice and dose extrapolation for experimental purposes. Each of these situations is discussed. Allometric scaling of drug doses is commonly used for practical reasons, but can be more accurate when one takes into account species differences in pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance, volume of distribution). Simple scaling of drug doses can be misleading for some drugs; correction for protein binding, physicochemical properties of the drug or species differences in physiological time can improve scaling. However, differences in drug transport and metabolism, and in the dose\u2013response relationship, can override the effect of size alone. For this reason, a range of modelling approaches have been developed, which combine in silico simulations with data obtained in vitro and/or in vivo. Drugs that are unlikely to be amenable to simple allometric scaling of their clearance or dose include drugs that are highly protein-bound, drugs that undergo extensive metabolism and active transport, drugs that undergo significant biliary excretion (MW > 500, ampiphilic, conjugated), drugs whose targets are subject to inter-species differences in expression, affinity and distribution and drugs that undergo extensive renal secretion.

Using this envelope assembly assay, we have studied the primary sequence requirements for particle formation of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) M protein, the major protein of the coronavirion membrane. Our results show that each of the different domains of the protein is important. Mutations (deletions, insertions, point mutations) in the luminal domain, the transmembrane domains, the amphiphilic domain, or the carboxy-terminal domain had effects on the assembly of M into enveloped particles. Strikingly, the extreme carboxy-terminal residue is crucial. Deletion of this single residue abolished particle assembly almost completely; most substitutions were strongly inhibitory. Site-directed mutations in the carboxy terminus of M were also incorporated into the MHV genome by targeted recombination. The results supported a critical role for this domain of M in viral assembly, although the M carboxy terminus was more tolerant of alteration in the complete virion than in virus-like particles, likely because of the stabilization of virions by additional intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, glycosylation of M appeared not essential for assembly. Mutations in the luminal domain that abolished the normal O glycosylation of the protein or created an N-glycosylated form had no effect. Mutant M proteins unable to form virus-like particles were found to inhibit the budding of assembly-competent M in a concentration-dependent manner. However, assembly-competent M was able to rescue assembly-incompetent M when the latter was present in low amounts.

We see that BBO has features in common with other biology-based optimization methods, such as GAs and particle swarm optimization (PSO). This makes BBO applicable to many of the same types of problems that GAs and PSO are used for, namely, high-dimension problems with multiple local optima. However, BBO also has some features that are unique among biology-based optimization methods. We demonstrate the performance of BBO on a set of 14 standard benchmarks and compare it with seven other biology-based optimization algorithms. We also demonstrate BBO on a real-world sensor selection problem for aircraft engine health estimation.", "date": "2008", "authors": ["D.

Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Findings Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59\u00b77 (SD 13\u00b73) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61\u00b75%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3\u201311) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64\u00b76 years [11\u00b72] vs 51\u00b79 years [12\u00b79]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13\u00b75%) patients. Interpretation The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1\u20132 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.

The in vitro DNA amplification technique, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has facilitated the use of these probes by greatly increasing the number of copies of target DNA in the sample prior to hybridization. In a conventional assay with immobilized PCR product and labeled oligonucleotide probes, each probe requires a separate hybridization. Here we describe a method by which one can simultaneously screen a sample for all known allelic variants at an amplified locus. In this format, the oligonucleotides are given homopolymer tails with terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase, spotted onto a nylon membrane, and covalently bound by UV irradiation. Due to their long length, the tails are preferentially bound to the nylon, leaving the oligonucleotide probe free to hybridize. The target segment of the DNA sample to be tested is PCR-amplified with biotinylated primers and then hybridized to the membrane containing the immobilized oligonucleotides under stringent conditions. Hybridization is detected nonradioactively by binding of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase to the biotinylated DNA, followed by a simple colorimetric reaction.

However, the classification accuracies of such in situ training using non-volatile-memory hardware have generally been less than those of software-based training, owing to insufficient dynamic range and excessive weight-update asymmetry. Here we demonstrate mixed hardware-software neural-network implementations that involve up to 204,900 synapses and that combine long-term storage in phase-change memory, near-linear updates of volatile capacitors and weight-data transfer with 'polarity inversion' to cancel out inherent device-to-device variations.

The biological basis for the severity of human H5N1 disease has remained unclear. We tested the hypothesis that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation has a role. Methods We used cDNA arrays and quantitative RT-PCR to compare the profile of cytokine gene expression induced by viruses A/HK/486/97 and A/HK/483/97 (both H5N1/97) with that of human H3N2 and H1N1 viruses in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro. Secretion of tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF \u03b1) from macrophages infected with the viruses was compared by ELISA. By use of naturally occurring viral reassortants and recombinant viruses generated by reverse genetic techniques, we investigated the viral genes associated with the TNF-\u03b1 response. Findings The H5N1/97 viruses induced much higher gene transcription of proinflammatory cytokines than did H3N2 or H1N1 viruses, particularly TNF \u03b1 and interferon beta. The concentration of TNF-\u03b1 protein in culture supernatants of macrophages infected with these viruses was similar to that induced by stimulation with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The non-structural ( NS ) gene-segment of H5N1/97 viruses contributed to the increase in TNF \u03b1 induced by the virus.

The major objective of this study was to explore if there are any scaling relations for landscape pattern when it is measured over a range of scales (grain size and extent). The results showed that the responses of landscape metrics to changing scale fell into two categories when computed at the class level (i.e., for individual land cover types): simple scaling functions and unpredictable behavior. Similarly, three categories were found at the landscape level, with the third being staircase pattern, in a previous study when all land cover types were combined together. In general, scaling relations were more variable at the class level than at the landscape level, and more consistent and predictable with changing grain size than with changing extent at both levels. Considering that the landscapes under study were quite diverse in terms of both composition and configuration, these results seem robust.

The elements of the dictionary can be interpreted as concepts, features, or words capable of succinct expression of events encountered in the environment (the source of the measured signals). This is a generalization of vector quantization in that one is interested in a description involving a few dictionary entries (the proverbial \"25 words or less\"), but not necessarily as succinct as one entry. To learn an environmentally adapted dictionary capable of concise expression of signals generated by the environment, we develop algorithms that iterate between a representative set of sparse representations found by variants of FOCUSS and an update of the dictionary using these sparse representations.Experiments were performed using synthetic data and natural images. For complete dictionaries, we demonstrate that our algorithms have improved performance over other independent component analysis (ICA) methods, measured in terms of signal-to-noise ratios of separated sources. In the overcomplete case, we show that the true underlying dictionary and sparse sources can be accurately recovered.

Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge.

All of these imply that shape is a selectable feature that aids survival. The aim of this review is to spell out the physical, environmental, and biological forces that favor different bacterial morphologies and which, therefore, contribute to natural selection. Specifically, cell shape is driven by eight general considerations: nutrient access, cell division and segregation, attachment to surfaces, passive dispersal, active motility, polar differentiation, the need to escape predators, and the advantages of cellular differentiation. Bacteria respond to these forces by performing a type of calculus, integrating over a number of environmental and behavioral factors to produce a size and shape that are optimal for the circumstances in which they live.

Thereafter it became more and more common that the new methods were provided with a complexity analysis, which was considered a better justification of their efficiency than computational experiments.

In contrast to the traditional approach, the recognition problem is formulated as one of matching appearance rather than shape. The appearance of an object in a two-dimensional image depends on its shape, reflectance properties, pose in the scene, and the illumination conditions. While shape and reflectance are intrinsic properties and constant for a rigid object, pose and illumination vary from scene to scene. A compact representation of object appearance is proposed that is parametrized by pose and illumination. For each object of interest, a large set of images is obtained by automatically varying pose and illumination. This image set is compressed to obtain a low-dimensional subspace, called the eigenspace, in which the object is represented as a manifold. Given an unknown input image, the recognition system projects the image to eigenspace. The object is recognized based on the manifold it lies on. The exact position of the projection on the manifold determines the object's pose in the image. A variety of experiments are conducted using objects with complex appearance characteristics. The performance of the recognition and pose estimation algorithms is studied using over a thousand input images of sample objects. Sensitivity of recognition to the number of eigenspace dimensions and the number of learning samples is analyzed. For the objects used, appearance representation in eigenspaces with less than 20 dimensions produces accurate recognition results with an average pose estimation error of about 1.0 degree.

Our multiple segmentation framework provides robust spatial support, allowing a wide variety of cues (e.g., color, texture, and perspective) to contribute to the confidence in each geometric label.

To meet the differing needs of many applications, the JPEG standard includes two basic compression methods, each with various modes of operation. A DCT (discrete cosine transform)-based method is specified for 'lossy' compression, and a predictive method for 'lossless' compression. JPEG features a simple lossy technique known as the Baseline method, a subset of the other DCT-based modes of operation. The Baseline method has been by far the most widely implemented JPEG method to date, and is sufficient in its own right for a large number of applications.

While most existing algorithms are able to track objects well in controlled environments, they usually fail in the presence of significant variation of the object's appearance or surrounding illumination. One reason for such failures is that many algorithms employ fixed appearance models of the target. Such models are trained using only appearance data available before tracking begins, which in practice limits the range of appearances that are modeled, and ignores the large volume of information (such as shape changes or specific lighting conditions) that becomes available during tracking. In this paper, we present a tracking method that incrementally learns a low-dimensional subspace representation, efficiently adapting online to changes in the appearance of the target. The model update, based on incremental algorithms for principal component analysis, includes two important features: a method for correctly updating the sample mean, and a forgetting factor to ensure less modeling power is expended fitting older observations.

Plant ecologists long ago recognized the importance of sampling scale in their descriptions of the dispersion or distribution of species (e.g. Greig-Smith, 1952). However, many ecologists have behaved as if patterns and the processes that produce them are insensitive to differences in scale and have designed their studies with little explicit attention to scale. Kareiva & Andersen (1988) surveyed nearly 100 field experiments in community ecology and found that half were conducted on plots no larger than 1 m in diameter, despite considerable differences in the sizes and types of organisms studied. Investigators addressing the same questions have often conducted their studies on quite different scales. Not surprisingly, their findings have not always matched, and arguments have ensued. The disagreements among conservation biologists over the optimal design of nature reserves (see Simberloff, 1988) are at least partly due to a failure to appreciate scaling differences among organisms.

This segment is 896 bp in length, contains the genes for three transfer RNAs and parts of two proteins, and is homologous in all 5 primates. The 5 sequences differ from one another by base substitutions at 283 positions and by a deletion of one base pair. The sequence differences range from 9 to 19% among species, in agreement with estimates from cleavage map comparisons, thus confirming that the rate of mtDNA evolution in primates is 5 to 10 times higher than in nuclear DNA. The most striking new finding to emerge from these comparisons is that transitions greatly outnumber transversions. Ninety-two percent of the differences among the most closely related species (human, chimpanzee, and gorilla) are transitions. For pairs of species with longer divergence times, the observed percentage of transitions falls until, in the case of comparisons between primates and non-primates, it reaches a value of 45. The time dependence is probably due to obliteration of the record of transitions by multiple substitutions at the same nucleotide site. This finding illustrates the importance of choosing closely related species for analysis of the evolutionary process. The remarkable bias toward transitions in mtDNA evolution necessitates the revision of equations that correct for multiple substitutions at the same site. With revised equations, we calculated the incidence of silent and replacement substitutions in the two protein-coding genes. The silent substitution rate is 4 to 6 times higher than the replacement rate, indicating strong functional constraints at replacement sites. Moreover, the silent rate for these two genes is about 10% per million years, a value 10 times higher than the silent rate for the nuclear genes studied so far. In addition, the mean substitution rate in the three mitochondrial tRNA genes is at least 100 times higher than in nuclear tRNA genes.

The formula, an approximation based on the assumption that the number of levels is large and overload distortion is negligible, is a useful tool for analytical studies of quantization. This paper gives a heuristic argument generalizing Bennett's formula to block quantization where a vector of random variables is quantized. The approach is again based on the asymptotic situation where N , the number of quantized output vectors, is very large. Using the resulting heuristic formula, an optimization is performed leading to an expression for the minimum quantizing noise attainable for any block quantizer of a given block size k . The results are consistent with Zador's results and specialize to known results for the one- and two-dimensional cases and for the case of infinite block length (k \\rightarrow \\infty) . The same heuristic approach also gives an alternate derivation of a bound of Elias for multidimensional quantization. Our approach leads to a rigorous method for obtaining upper bounds on the minimum distortion for block quantizers. In particular, for k = 3 we give a tight upper bound that may in fact be exact.

Although bats have been suggested to be the natural reservoirs of both viruses, attempts to isolate the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV from bats have been unsuccessful. Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have now been reported from bats in China, Europe and Africa, but none is considered a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV because of their phylogenetic disparity from this virus and the inability of their spike proteins to use the SARS-CoV cellular receptor molecule, the human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here we report whole-genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: Rhinolophidae) in Yunnan, China: RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat coronaviruses, particularly in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs.

Although virus replication was low, infection led to cell death which was characterized by an extreme intracellular vacuolization. Most importantly, influenza A virus infection was accompanied by a particular pattern of cytokine release. Whereas IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 production was dependent on exposure to infectious virus, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 release was also induced by UV-inactivated virus. Although influenza A virus infection alone induced a substantial cytokine mRNA accumulation, translation into bioactive cytokine protein was rather limited. However, addition of low LPS concentrations was capable of strongly potentiating cytokine release from virus-infected cells. Thus, in a first step, an influenza A virus infection primes mononuclear phagocytes by leading to an accumulation of cytokine mRNA which, in a second step, may be readily translated into bioactive cytokines when triggering signals such as LPS are available. These findings suggest that influenza A virus represents an ultimately fatal macrophage activating factor which, when inducing moderate amounts of cytokines, may be beneficial by mounting an immediate antiviral response, but which may cause adverse effects when cytokine release is highly elevated by bacterial products.", "date": "1993", "authors": ["Theodor Peschke , Armin Bender , Marianne Nain , Diethard Gemsa"], "related_topics": ["Influenza A virus", "Orthomyxoviridae", "Virus", "Cytokine", "Macrophage-activating factor", "Macrophage", "Phagocyte", "Viral replication", "Microbiology", "Immunology", "Biology"], "citation_count": "115", "reference_count": "30", "references": ["2015913105", "2048325240", "2122462682", "2131115069", "2085374906", "1960701436", "1663957057", "1559480775", "1993260002", "1691371551"]}, {"id": "2159737176", "title": "Training Invariant Support Vector Machines", "abstract": "Practical experience has shown that in order to obtain the best possible performance, prior knowledge about invariances of a classification problem at hand ought to be incorporated into the training procedure.

We previously showed that the brain was a major target organ for infection in mice that are transgenic for the SARS-CoV receptor (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Herein, we use these mice to show that virus enters the brain primarily via the olfactory bulb, and infection results in rapid, transneuronal spread to connected areas of the brain. This extensive neuronal infection is the main cause of death because intracranial inoculation with low doses of virus results in a uniformly lethal disease even though little infection is detected in the lungs. Death of the animal likely results from dysfunction and/or death of infected neurons, especially those located in cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla.

Data is encoded by a channel code and the encoded data is split into n streams that are simultaneously transmitted using n transmit antennas. The received signal at each receive antenna is a linear superposition of the n transmitted signals perturbed by noise. We derive performance criteria for designing such codes under the assumption that the fading is slow and frequency nonselective. Performance is shown to be determined by matrices constructed from pairs of distinct code sequences. The minimum rank among these matrices quantifies the diversity gain, while the minimum determinant of these matrices quantifies the coding gain. The results are then extended to fast fading channels. The design criteria are used to design trellis codes for high data rate wireless communication. The encoding/decoding complexity of these codes is comparable to trellis codes employed in practice over Gaussian channels. The codes constructed here provide the best tradeoff between data rate, diversity advantage, and trellis complexity.

(2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix. Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.

Findings Fever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8\u00b79 (SD 3\u00b71) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7\u00b75 (2\u00b73) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7\u00b74 (2\u00b72) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8\u00b76 (3\u00b70) days. In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission. Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0\u00b7001). SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days.

Although adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was nearly constant for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial. This same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and accumulated hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral signature.

The provirus of ATLV integrated in DNA of leukemia T cells from a patient with ATL was molecularly cloned and the complete nucleotide sequence of 9,032 bases of the proviral genome was determined. The provirus DNA contains two long terminal repeats (LTRs) consisting of 755 bases, one at each end, which are flanked by a 6-base direct repeat of the cellular DNA sequence. The nucleotides in the LTR could be arranged into a unique secondary structure, which could explain transcriptional termination within the 3' LTR but not in the 5' LTR. The nucleotide sequence of the provirus contains three large open reading frames, which are capable of coding for proteins of 48,000, 99,000, and 54,000 daltons. The three open frames are in this order from the 5' end of the viral genome and the predicted 48,000-dalton polypeptide is a precursor of gag proteins, because it has an identical amino acid sequence to that of the NH2 terminus of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) p24.

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done \u22641 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. Findings 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49\u00b75 years (SD 11\u00b70). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10\u00b75 (SD 6\u00b74) overall, 2\u00b78 (3\u00b73) in group 1, 11\u00b71 (5\u00b74) in group 2, 13\u00b70 (5\u00b77) in group 3, and 12\u00b71 (5\u00b79) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). Interpretation COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1\u20133 weeks.

A total of 1426 patients (12-70 years) presenting within 48 h of the onset of influenza symptoms were treated with oseltamivir 75 mg twice a day for 5 days during the 1999-2000 influenza season; 958 (67%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection. Earlier intervention was associated with shorter illness duration (P < 0.0001). Initiation of therapy within the first 12 h after fever onset reduced the total median illness duration by 74.6 h (3.1 days; 41%) more than intervention at 48 h. Intermediate interventions reduced the illness proportionately compared with 48 h. In addition, the earlier administration of oseltamivir further reduced the duration of fever, severity of symptoms and the times to return to baseline activity and health scores. Oseltamivir was well tolerated. The most common adverse events were nausea and vomiting, which were transient and generally occurred only with first dosing. When oseltamivir was taken with food, the tolerability was enhanced. The overall discontinuation rate was low (1.8%). In conclusion, the IMPACT study demonstrated that earlier initiation of oral oseltamivir therapy increased its therapeutic effects, which were seen at every time point of intervention and were progressive.

Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector q0 and frequency \u03c90 of the instability. Type Is systems (\u03c90=0, q0\u22600) are stationary in time and periodic in space; type IIIo systems (\u03c90\u22600, q0=0) are periodic in time and uniform in space; and type Io systems (\u03c90\u22600, q0\u22600) are periodic in both space and time. Near a continuous (or supercritical) instability, the dynamics may be accurately described via \"amplitude equations,\" whose form is universal for each type of instability. The specifics of each system enter only through the nonuniversal coefficients. Far from the instability threshold a different universal description known as the \"phase equation\" may be derived, but it is restricted to slow distortions of an ideal pattern. For many systems appropriate starting equations are either not known or too complicated to analyze conveniently. It is thus useful to introduce phenomenological order-parameter models, which lead to the correct amplitude equations near threshold, and which may be solved analytically or numerically in the nonlinear regime away from the instability. The above theoretical methods are useful in analyzing \"real pattern effects\" such as the influence of external boundaries, or the formation and dynamics of defects in ideal structures. An important element in nonequilibrium systems is the appearance of deterministic chaos. A greal deal is known about systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying \"temporal chaos,\" where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail. For spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, on the other hand, one is dealing with spatiotemporal chaos and appropriate methods of analysis need to be developed. In addition to the general features of nonequilibrium pattern formation discussed above, detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental work on many specific systems are presented. These include Rayleigh-Benard convection in a pure fluid, convection in binary-fluid mixtures, electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals, Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders, parametric surface waves, patterns in certain open flow systems, oscillatory chemical reactions, static and dynamic patterns in biological media, crystallization fronts, and patterns in nonlinear optics.

ANIMALS: 12 dairy herds in Ohio affected with WD (case herds). For each case herd, 2 unaffected herds from the same area were concurrently used as control herds. PROCEDURE: A case-control study was conducted, using herds as the unit of investigation. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk factors for contracting disease. RESULTS: 4 factors appeared to increase a herd's risk for WD: increase in herd prevalence of adult cows that had a fourfold or more increase in BCV serum IgG antibody titer; increase in herd prevalence of adult cows that had a fourfold or more increase in bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) titer; housing cattle in tiestall or stanchion barns rather than free-stall facilities; and use of equipment to handle manure and subsequently handle feed. The adjusted population-attributable risk for these variables was 71, 43, 53, and 31%, respectively, and 99% overall, indicating that these variables had considerable impact on WD outbreaks for the study population.

In this Part II, experimental work is presented which confirms the validity of the solute paradigm. TiB2 particle additions were found to refine the columnar zone of pure aluminum; however, an equiaxed structure was only observed when a small amount of titanium was added as solute. The potency of nucleant particles was confirmed by thermal analysis, which showed that additions of TiB2 to pure aluminium removed the nucleation undercooling. Upon the addition of more TiB2 particles and titanium as solute, the grain size continued to decrease until an apparent minimum grain size was achieved, past which little further refinement occurs. That the segregating ability of solute elements in general is essential for grain refinement, and not only that of titanium in particular, was confirmed by comparison of the Al-2Si and Al-0.05Ti systems. Finally, a mechanism of grain refinement is presented that incorporates both nucleant particles and solute segregation as essential for effective grain refinement. The solute is required to form a constitutionally undercooled zone in front of the growing solid/liquid interface to facilitate further nucleation on the substrates present.

Here we describe an objective method for quantifying qRT-PCR results using calculations based on the kinetics of individual PCR reactions without the need of the standard curve, independent of any assumptions or subjective judgments which allow direct calculation of efficiency and CT. We use a four-parameter logistic model to fit the raw fluorescence data as a function of PCR cycles to identify the exponential phase of the reaction. Next, we use a three-parameter simple exponent model to fit the exponential phase using an iterative nonlinear regression algorithm. Within the exponential portion of the curve, our technique automatically identifies candidate regression values using the P-value of regression and then uses a weighted average to compute a final efficiency for quantification. For CT determination, we chose the first positive second derivative maximum from the logistic model.

The explosive spread of the virus and the rapid increase in the number of cases require the immediate development of effective therapies and vaccines as well as accurate diagnosis tools. The pathogenesis of the disease is triggered by the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via its spike protein into ACE2-bearing host cells, particularly pneumocytes, resulting in overactivation of the immune system, which attacks the infected cells and damages the lung tissue. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with host cells is primarily mediated by the N-terminal helix of ACE2; thus, inhibition of the spike-ACE2 interaction may be a promising therapeutic strategy for blocking the virus entry into host cells. In this paper, we used an in-silico approach to explore small-molecule \u03b1-helix mimetics as inhibitors that may disrupt the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2. First, the RBD-ACE2 interface in the 6M0J structure was studied by the MM-GBSA decomposition module of the HawkDock server, which led to the identification of two critical target regions in the RBD. Next, two virtual screening experiments of 7236 \u03b1-helix mimetics from ASINEX were conducted on the above regions using the iDock tool, which resulted in 10 candidates with favorable binding affinities. Finally, the stability of RBD complexes with the top-two ranked compounds was further validated by 100 ns of molecular dynamics simulations. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This editing results in the addition of an extra nontemplated adenosine within a run of seven adenosines near the middle of the coding region. The primary gene product is a smaller (50-70 kDa), nonstructural, secreted glycoprotein, which is produced in large amounts and has an unknown function.

Several RNA viruses and infections caused by these viruses are coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, rotavirus and reovirus, and picornaviruses.

For established colonies, monitoring should be tailored to local conditions. Effective monitoring should encompass sampling on a pre-arranged schedule, which can be intensified if evidence or suspicion of viral infection emerges.

We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing. Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to \"Disease X\" (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 59%. Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen.

Decisions about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions. The objectives of this study were to update and reassess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and (a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and (b) GBS in any population, and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality. METHODS AND FINDINGS The study had three linked components. First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in ten dimensions: temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response relationship, animal experiments, analogy, specificity, and consistency. Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693). We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively. Third, WHO convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts who assessed the review findings and reached consensus statements to update the WHO position on causality. We found 1,091 unique items up to May 30, 2016. For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of ten causality dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity), we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection. For GBS, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except dose-response relationship, specificity, and animal experimental evidence). Articles identified nonsystematically from May 30 to July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings. The expert panel concluded that (a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including microcephaly, and (b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and GBS is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of GBS. The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or GBS but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures. Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible cofactors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research. CONCLUSIONS Rapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge. This systematic review found sufficient evidence to say that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of GBS.", "date": "2017", "authors": ["Fabienne Krauer 1, Maurane Riesen 1, Ludovic Reveiz 2, Olufemi T.

A common constraint is that the labels should vary smoothly almost everywhere while preserving sharp discontinuities that may exist, e.g., at object boundaries. These tasks are naturally stated in terms of energy minimization. The authors consider a wide class of energies with various smoothness constraints. Global minimization of these energy functions is NP-hard even in the simplest discontinuity-preserving case. Therefore, our focus is on efficient approximation algorithms. We present two algorithms based on graph cuts that efficiently find a local minimum with respect to two types of large moves, namely expansion moves and swap moves. These moves can simultaneously change the labels of arbitrarily large sets of pixels. In contrast, many standard algorithms (including simulated annealing) use small moves where only one pixel changes its label at a time. Our expansion algorithm finds a labeling within a known factor of the global minimum, while our swap algorithm handles more general energy functions. Both of these algorithms allow important cases of discontinuity preserving energies. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for image restoration, stereo and motion.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Findings 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1\u00b710, 95% CI 1\u00b703\u20131\u00b717, per year increase; p=0\u00b70043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5\u00b765, 2\u00b761\u201312\u00b723; p Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

We develop MEDUSA, a stepwise approach based upon the Akaike information criterion for detecting multiple shifts in birth and death rates on an incompletely resolved phylogeny. We apply MEDUSA incompletely to a diversity tree summarizing both evolutionary relationships and species richness of 44 major clades of jawed vertebrates. We identify 9 major changes in the tempo of gnathostome diversification; the most significant of these lies at the base of a clade that includes most of the coral-reef associated fishes as well as cichlids and perches. Rate increases also underlie several well recognized tetrapod radiations, including most modern birds, lizards and snakes, ostariophysan fishes, and most eutherian mammals.

All alignments used a similarity approach based on a general algorithm devised by Needleman and Wunsch. The approaches included a simple program, UM (unitary matrix), whereby only identities are scored; a scheme in which the genetic code is used as a basis for weighting (GC); another that employs a matrix based on structural similarity of amino acids taken together with the genetic basis of mutation (SG); and a fourth that uses the empirical log-odds matrix (LOM) developed by Dayhoff on the basis of observed amino acid replacements. The two sequence families examined were (a) nine different globins and (b) nine different tyrosine kinase-like proteins. It was assumed a priori that all members of a family share common ancestry. In cases where two sequences were more than 30% identical, alignments by all four methods were almost always the same. In cases where the percentage identity was less than 20%, however, there were often significant differences in the alignments. On the average, the Dayhoff LOM approach was the most effective in verifying distant relationships, as judged by an empirical \u201cjumbling test.\u201d This was not universally the case, however, and in some instances the simple UM was actually as good or better.

Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing.

Traditional methods like principal component analysis and classical metric multidimensional scaling suffer from being based on linear models. Until recently, very few methods were able to reduce the data dimensionality in a nonlinear way. However, since the late nineties, many new methods have been developed and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also called manifold learning, has become a hot topic. New advances that account for this rapid growth are, e.g. the use of graphs to represent the manifold topology, and the use of new metrics like the geodesic distance. In addition, new optimization schemes, based on kernel techniques and spectral decomposition, have lead to spectral embedding, which encompasses many of the recently developed methods. This book describes existing and advanced methods to reduce the dimensionality of numerical databases. For each method, the description starts from intuitive ideas, develops the necessary mathematical details, and ends by outlining the algorithmic implementation. Methods are compared with each other with the help of different illustrative examples. The purpose of the book is to summarize clear facts and ideas about well-known methods as well as recent developments in the topic of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. With this goal in mind, methods are all described from a unifying point of view, in order to highlight their respective strengths and shortcomings.

Rapid prototyping is an approach which allows crucial design decisions as early as possible. A rapid prototyping system should support maximal re-use and innovative combinations of existing methods, as well as simple and quick integration of new ones.This paper describes Yale, a free open-source environment forKDD and machine learning.

The methods examined are UPGMA, Farris' (1972) method, and Tateno et al.'s (1982) modified Farris method. In the computer simulation eight species (or populations) were assumed to evolve according to a given model tree, and the evolutionary changes of allele frequencies were followed by using the infinite-allele model. At the end of the simulated evolution five genetic distance measures (Nei's standard and minimum distances, Rogers' distance, Cavalli-Sforza's f\u03bb, and the modified Cavalli-Sforza distance) were computed for all pairs of species, and the distance matrix obtained for each distance measure was used for reconstructing a phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic tree obtained was then compared with the model tree. The results obtained indicate that in all tree-making methods examined the accuracies of both the topology and branch lengths of a reconstructed tree (rooted tree) are very low when the number of loci used is less than 20 but gradually increase with increasing number of loci. When the expected number of gene substitutions (M) for the shortest branch is 0.1 or more per locus and 30 or more loci are used, the topological error as measured by the distortion index (dT) is not great, but the probability of obtaining the correct topology (P) is less than 0.5 even with 60 loci. When M is as small as 0.004, P is substantially lower. In obtaining a good topology (small dT and high P) UPGMA and the modified Farris method generally show a better performance than the Farris method. The poor performance of the Farris method is observed even when Rogers' distance which obeys the triangle inequality is used. The main reason for this seems to be that the Farris method often gives overestimates of branch lengths. For estimating the expected branch lengths of the true tree UPGMA shows the best performance. For this purpose Nei's standard distance gives a better result than the others because of its linear relationship with the number of gene substitutions. Rogers' or Cavalli-Sforza's distance gives a phylogenetic tree in which the parts near the root are condensed and the other parts are elongated. It is recommended that more than 30 loci, including both polymorphic and monomorphic loci, be used for making phylogentic trees.

Methods Data were pooled from 18 cohorts of community-dwelling elderly members of one U.S. health maintenance organization (HMO) for 1990\u20131991 through 1999\u20132000 and of two other HMOs for 1996\u20131997 through 1999\u20132000. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine for the prevention of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza and death after adjustment for important covariates. Additional analyses explored for evidence of bias and the potential effect of residual confounding. Results There were 713,872 person-seasons of observation. Most high-risk medical conditions that were measured were more prevalent among vaccinated than among unvaccinated persons. Vaccination was associated with a 27% reduction in the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza (adjusted odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.77) and a 48% reduction in the risk of death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.55). Estimates were generally stable across age and risk subgroups. In the sensitivity analyses, we modeled the effect of a hypothetical unmeasured confounder that would have caused overestimation of vaccine effectiveness in the main analysis; vaccination was still associated with statistically significant \u2014 though lower \u2014 reductions in the risks of both hospitalization and death.

Immunologic testing revealed that absolute lymphocyte counts, T-cell counts, and lymphocyte proliferation were depressed, and that humoral immunity was intact.

These cytokines induce a pleiotropic set of growth and differentiation activities via receptors that use a common signaling subunit, gp130.

We find that CT-1 is inactive in stimulating the growth of the hybridoma cell line, B9 and inhibits the growth of the mouse myeloid leukemia cell line, M1. CT-1 induces a phenotypic switch in rat sympathetic neurons and promotes the survival of rat dopaminergic and chick ciliary neurons. CT-1 also inhibits the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. CT-1 and LIF cross-compete for binding to M1 cells, K[CT-1] 0.7 nM, and this binding is inhibited by an anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody.

Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation. They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection. Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies. We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice. Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation. Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs. Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis. These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells. The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus. Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS. The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.

During this latter outbreak we conducted several epidemiological investigations to identify the underlying ecological conditions and animal sources. Qualitative social and environmental data were collected through interviews with villagers and by direct observation. The local populations reported no unusual morbidity or mortality among wild or domestic animals, but they described a massive annual fruit bat migration toward the southeast, up the Lulua River. Migrating bats settled in the outbreak area for several weeks, between April and May, nestling in the numerous fruit trees in Ndongo and Koumelele islands as well as in palm trees of a largely abandoned plantation. They were massively hunted by villagers, for whom they represented a major source of protein. By tracing back the initial human-human transmission events, we were able to show that, in May, the putative first human victim bought freshly killed bats from hunters to eat. We were able to reconstruct the likely initial human-human transmission events that preceded the outbreak. This study provides the most likely sequence of events linking a human Ebola outbreak to exposure to fruit bats, a putative virus reservoir.

In resistant CPMV movement protein (MP) gene-transformed lines, transgene steady state mRNA levels were low, whereas nuclear transcription rates were high, implying that a post-transcriptional gene-silencing mechanism is at the base of the resistance. The silencing mechanism can also affect potato virus X (PVX) RNAs when they contain CPMV MP gene sequences. In particular, sequences situated in the 3[prime] part of the transcribed region of the MP transgene direct elimination of recombinant PVX genomes. Remarkably, successive portions of this 3[prime] part, which can be as small as 60 nucleotides, all tag PVX genomes for degradation. These observations suggest that the entire 3[prime] part of the MP transgene mRNA is the initial target of the silencing mechanism. The arrangement of transgenes in the plant genome plays an important role in establishing resistance because the frequency of resistant lines increased from 20 to 60% when transformed with a transgene containing a direct repeat of MP sequences rather than a single MP transgene.

A subset of T lymphocytes positive for the CD4 antigen (also termed T4 antigen), is depleted in AIDS and PGL patients. A retrovirus found in T-cell cultures from these patients is strongly implicated in the aetiology of AIDS because of the high frequency of isolation and the prevalence of specific antibodies in the patients. Here we have detected cell-surface receptors for the AIDS retrovirus (human T-cell leukaemia virus-III (HTLV-III) and lymphadenopathy-associated virus-1 (LAV-1) isolates) by testing the susceptibility of cells to infection with pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus bearing retroviral envelope antigens, and by the formation of multinucleated syncytia on mixing virus-producing cells with receptor-bearing cells. Receptors were present only on cells expressing CD4 antigen; among 155 monoclonal antibodies tested, each of the 14 anti-CD4 antibodies inhibited formation of syncytia and blocked pseudotypes. Productive infection of CD4+ cells with HTLV-III or LAV-1 markedly reduced cell-surface expression of CD4. In contrast, receptors for HTLV-I and HTLV-II were not restricted to CD4+ cells, were not blocked by anti-CD4 antibodies; cells productively infected with HTLV-I and HTLV-II expressed surface CD4.

The idea is to map the data to compact binary codes whose Hamming distances are minimized on similar pairs and simultaneously maximized on dissimilar pairs.

It will discuss applications of backpropagation to forecasting over time (where errors have been halved by using methods other than least squares), to optimization, to sensitivity analysis, and to brain research. This paper will go on to derive a generalization of backpropagation to recurrent systems (which input their own output), such as hybrids of perceptron-style networks and Grossberg/Hopfield networks.

Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for >30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that \u201creplayed\u201d evolution from different points in that population's history.

However, we observed a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized hypermutability.

Healthy adults are presently targeted mainly in North America. Objectives Identify, retrieve and assess all studies evaluating the effects of vaccines against influenza in healthy adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2010, issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2010) and EMBASE (1990 to June 2010). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing influenza vaccines with placebo or no intervention in naturally-occurring influenza in healthy individuals aged 16 to 65 years. We also included comparative studies assessing serious and rare harms. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Main results We included 50 reports. Forty (59 sub-studies) were clinical trials of over 70,000 people. Eight were comparative non-RCTs and assessed serious harms. Two were reports of harms which could not be introduced in the data analysis. In the relatively uncommon circumstance of vaccine matching the viral circulating strain and high circulation, 4% of unvaccinated people versus 1% of vaccinated people developed influenza symptoms (risk difference (RD) 3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 5%). The corresponding figures for poor vaccine matching were 2% and 1% (RD 1, 95% CI 0% to 3%). These differences were not likely to be due to chance. Vaccination had a modest effect on time off work and had no effect on hospital admissions or complication rates. Inactivated vaccines caused local harms and an estimated 1.6 additional cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome per million vaccinations. The harms evidence base is limited. Authors' conclusions Influenza vaccines have a modest effect in reducing influenza symptoms and working days lost. There is no evidence that they affect complications, such as pneumonia, or transmission. WARNING: This review includes 15 out of 36 trials funded by industry (four had no funding declaration). An earlier systematic review of 274 influenza vaccine studies published up to 2007 found industry funded studies were published in more prestigious journals and cited more than other studies independently from methodological quality and size. Studies funded from public sources were significantly less likely to report conclusions favorable to the vaccines.

Recent studies have resurrected the debate over the value for the allometric scaling exponent that relates whole-organism metabolic rate to body size. Is it 3 / 4 or 2 / 3 ? This question has been raised before and resolved in favour of 3 / 4 . Like previous ones, recent claims for a value of 2 / 3 are based almost entirely on basal metabolic rate (BMR) in mammals. 2. Here we compile and analyse a new, larger data set for mammalian BMR. We show that interspecific variation in BMR, as well as field metabolic rates of mammals, and basal or standard metabolic rates for many other organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrates, protists and plants, all scale with exponents whose confidence intervals include 3 / 4 and exclude 2 / 3 . Our analysis of maximal metabolic rate gives a slope that is greater than and confidence intervals that exclude both 3 / 4 and 2 / 3 . 3. Additionally, numerous other physiological rates that are closely tied to metabolism in a wide variety of organisms, including heart and respiratory rates in mammals, scale as M \u2212 1/4 . 4.

Population-based studies in the developed world suggest that the burden of critical illness is higher than generally appreciated and will increase as the population ages. Critical care capacity has long been needed in the developing world, and efforts to improve the care of the critically ill in these settings are starting to occur. Expansion of critical care to handle the consequences of an ageing population, natural disasters, conflict, inadequate primary care, and higher-risk medical therapies will be challenged by high costs at a time of economic constraint.

We examined 191 separate sets of kinematic patterns that differed with respect to stroke amplitude, angle of attack, flip timing, flip duration and the shape and magnitude of stroke deviation. Instantaneous aerodynamic forces were measured using a two-dimensional force sensor mounted at the base of the wing. The influence of unsteady rotational effects was assessed by comparing the time course of measured forces with that of corresponding translational quasi-steady estimates. For each pattern, we also calculated mean stroke-averaged values of the force coefficients and an estimate of profile power. The results of this analysis may be divided into four main points. (i) For a short, symmetrical wing flip, mean lift was optimized by a stroke amplitude of 180\u00b0 and an angle of attack of 50\u00b0. At all stroke amplitudes, mean drag increased monotonically with increasing angle of attack. Translational quasi-steady predictions better matched the measured values at high stroke amplitude than at low stroke amplitude. This discrepancy was due to the increasing importance of rotational mechanisms in kinematic patterns with low stroke amplitude. (ii) For a 180\u00b0 stroke amplitude and a 45\u00b0 angle of attack, lift was maximized by short-duration flips occurring just slightly in advance of stroke reversal. Symmetrical rotations produced similarly high performance. Wing rotation that occurred after stroke reversal, however, produced very low mean lift. (iii) The production of aerodynamic forces was sensitive to changes in the magnitude of the wing\u2019s deviation from the mean stroke plane (stroke deviation) as well as to the actual shape of the wing tip trajectory. However, in all examples, stroke deviation lowered aerodynamic performance relative to the no deviation case. This attenuation was due, in part, to a trade-off between lift and a radially directed component of total aerodynamic force. Thus, while we found no evidence that stroke deviation can augment lift, it nevertheless may be used to modulate forces on the two wings. Thus, insects might use such changes in wing kinematics during steering maneuvers to generate appropriate force moments. (iv) While quasi-steady estimates failed to capture the time course of measured lift for nearly all kinematic patterns, they did predict with reasonable accuracy stroke-averaged values for the mean lift coefficient. However, quasi-steady estimates grossly underestimated the magnitude of the mean drag coefficient under all conditions. This discrepancy was due to the contribution of rotational effects that steady-state estimates do not capture. This result suggests that many prior estimates of mechanical power based on wing kinematics may have been grossly underestimated.", "date": "2001", "authors": ["Sanjay P. Sane , Michael H.

A typical example is information filtering, i.e. the adaptive classification of documents with respect to a particular user interest. Both the interest of the user and the document content change over time. A filtering system should be able to adapt to such concept changes. This paper proposes several methods to handle such concept drifts with support vector machines. The methods either maintain an adaptive time window on the training data [13], select representative training examples, or weight the training examples [15]. The key idea is to automatically adjust the window size, the example selection, and the example weighting, respectively, so that the estimated generalization error is minimized. The approaches are both theoretically well-founded as well as effective and efficient in practice. Since they do not require complicated parameterization, they are simpler to use and more robust than comparable heuristics. Experiments with simulated concept drift scenarios based on real-world text data compare the new methods with other window management approaches. We show that they can effectively select an appropriate window size, example selection, and example weighting, respectively, in a robust way. We also explain how the proposed example selection and weighting approaches can be turned into incremental approaches. Since most evaluation methods for machine learning, like e.g. cross-validation, assume that the examples are independent and identically distributed, which is clearly unrealistic in the case of concept drift, alternative evaluation schemes are used to estimate and optimize the performance of each learning step within the concept drift handling frameworks as well as to evaluate and compare the different frameworks.", "date": "2004", "authors": ["Ralf Klinkenberg"], "related_topics": ["Concept drift", "Weighting", "Heuristics", "Support vector machine", "Independent and identically distributed random variables", "Selection (genetic algorithm)", "Machine learning", "Data mining", "Window (computing)", "Computer science", "Key (cryptography)", "Artificial intelligence"], "citation_count": "583", "reference_count": "24", "references": ["2148603752", "2149684865", "1978394996", "1493526108", "2108807072", "2022775778", "2012516036", "1539150806", "148103248/", "2118383892"]}, {"id": "1415981329", "title": "The autonomously replicating parvoviruses of vertebrates.", "abstract": "Publisher Summary Various aspects of the natural history of autonomous parvoviruses are beginning to be understood in some detail, mostly through the analysis of tissue culture analogs of the pathogenic processes observed in the whole animal.

This paper investigates machine learning techniques for LOS identification in V2V networks using an extensive set of measurement data and then develops robust and efficient identification solutions. Our approach exploits several static and time-varying features of the channel impulse response (CIR), which are shown to be effective.

Moreover, based on the measurement data, we also compare three different machine learning methods, i.e., support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network, in terms of their ability to train and generate the classifier. The results of our experiments conducted under various V2V environments, which were then validated using $K$ -fold cross-validation, show that our techniques can distinguish the LOS/NLOS conditions with an error rate as low as 1%.

While the spatial order characterizing for example the crystals has been the basis of many advances in contemporary physics, most complex systems in nature do not offer such high degree of order. Many of these systems form complex networks whose nodes are the elements of the system and edges represent the interactions between them. Traditionally complex networks have been described by the random graph theory founded in 1959 by Paul Erdohs and Alfred Renyi. One of the defining features of random graphs is that they are statistically homogeneous, and their degree distribution (characterizing the spread in the number of edges starting from a node) is a Poisson distribution. In contrast, recent empirical studies, including the work of our group, indicate that the topology of real networks is much richer than that of random graphs. In particular, the degree distribution of real networks is a power-law, indicating a heterogeneous topology in which the majority of the nodes have a small degree, but there is a significant fraction of highly connected nodes that play an important role in the connectivity of the network. The scale-free topology of real networks has very important consequences on their functioning. For example, we have discovered that scale-free networks are extremely resilient to the random disruption of their nodes. On the other hand, the selective removal of the nodes with highest degree induces a rapid breakdown of the network to isolated subparts that cannot communicate with each other. The non-trivial scaling of the degree distribution of real networks is also an indication of their assembly and evolution. Indeed, our modeling studies have shown us that there are general principles governing the evolution of networks. Most networks start from a small seed and grow by the addition of new nodes which attach to the nodes already in the system. This process obeys preferential attachment: the new nodes are more likely to connect to nodes with already high degree. We have proposed a simple model based on these two principles wich was able to reproduce the power-law degree distribution of real networks. Perhaps even more importantly, this model paved the way to a new paradigm of network modeling, trying to capture the evolution of networks, not just their static topology.", "date": "2000", "authors": ["Reka Zsuzsanna Albert , Albert-Laszlo Barabasi"], "related_topics": ["Degree distribution", "Evolving networks", "Hierarchical network model", "Complex network", "Spatial network", "Interdependent networks", "Scale-free network", "Small-world network", "Theoretical computer science", "Physics"], "citation_count": "24,997", "reference_count": "175", "references": ["2112090702", "2008620264", "2061901927", "2065769502", "2164727176", "2078206416", "1976969221", "2769133055", "3113109455", "2905110430"]}, {"id": "1505652865", "title": "NETtalk: a parallel network that learns to read aloud", "abstract": "", "date": "1987", "authors": ["Terrence J.

The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X -- 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X -- 80X higher.

This study was designed to determine the most appropriate method to normalize left ventricular mass for body size. Background. Left ventricular mass has been normalized for body weight, surface area or height in experimental and clinical studies, but it is uncertain which of these approaches is most appropriate. Methods. Three normotensive population samples\u2014in New York City (127 adults), Naples, Italy (114 adults) and Cincinnati, Ohio (444 infants to young adults)\u2014were studied by echocardiography. Relations of left ventricular mass to body size were similar in all normal weight groups, as assessed by linear and nonlinear regression analysis, and results were pooled (n = 611). Results. Left ventricular mass was related to body weight to the first power (r = 0.88), to body surface area to the 1.5 power (r = 0.88) and to height to the 2.7 power (r = 0.84), consistent with expected aliometric (growth) relations between variables with linear (height), second-power (body surface area) and volumetric (left ventricular mass and body weight) dimensions. Strong residual relations of left ventricular mass/body surface area to body surface area (r = 0.54) and of ventricular mass/height to height (r = 0.72) were markedly reduced by normalization of ventricular mass for height2.7and body surface area1.5. The variability among subjects of ventricular mass was also reduced (p < 0.01 to p < 0.002) by normalization for body weight, body surface area, body surface area1.5or height2.7but not for height, In 20% of adults who were overweight, ventricular mass was 14% higher (p < 0.001) than ideal mass predicted from observed height and ideal weight; this increase was identified as 14% by left ventricular mass/height2.7and 9% by ventricular mass/height, whereas indexation for body surface area, body surface area1.5and body weight erroneously identified left ventricular mass as reduced in overweight adults. Conclusions. Normalizations of left ventricular mass for height or body surface area introduce artifactual relations of indexed ventricular mass to body size and errors ia estimating the impact of overweight. These problems are avoided and variability among normal subjects is reduced by using left ventricular mass/height2.7.

All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads. The models are evaluated on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, showing that their accuracy is competitive with other models in the literature. To gain a better understanding of the models, we also give results on different constituent types, as well as a breakdown of precision/recall results in recovering various types of dependencies. We analyze various characteristics of the models through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collecting frequencies of various structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples.

Two unusual extensions are presented: Multiscale, which adds the ability to visualize large-scale molecular assemblies such as viral coats, and Collaboratory, which allows researchers to share a Chimera session interactively despite being at separate locales. Other extensions include Multalign Viewer, for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated structures; ViewDock, for screening docked ligand orientations; Movie, for replaying molecular dynamics trajectories; and Volume Viewer, for display and analysis of volumetric data. A discussion of the usage of Chimera in real-world situations is given, along with anticipated future directions. Chimera includes full user documentation, is free to academic and nonprofit users, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, SGI IRIX, and HP Tru64 Unix from http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/.", "date": "2004", "authors": ["Eric F.

We excluded studies with Results Seventy-two studies were included in the analysis. There was a wide variation in mortality rates among the studies (15 to 72%). The overall pooled mortality rate for all studies was 43% (95% confidence interval, 40 to 46%). Metaregression analysis suggested a significant decrease in overall mortality rates of approximately 1.1%/yr over the period analyzed (1994 to 2006).

Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas : 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations.

The viral construct with the substituted coat protein gene accumulated poorly in inoculated protoplasts and failed to spread from the site of infection in plants. These results suggest a role for the viral coat protein in key stages of the viral infection cycle and show that gene replacement constructs are not suitable for the production of PVX-based gene vector. The construct with GUS coupled to the duplicated promoter for coat protein mRNA also accumulated less well in protoplasts than the unmodified PVX, but did infect systemically and directed high level synthesis of GUS in inoculated and systemically infected tissue.

During each complete stroke cycle, the flies generate one single vortex loop consisting of vorticity shed during the downstroke and ventral flip. This gross pattern of wake structure in Drosophila is similar to those described for hovering birds and some other insects. The wake structure differed from those previously described, however, in that the vortex filaments shed during ventral stroke reversal did not fuse to complete a circular ring, but rather attached temporarily to the body to complete an inverted heart-shaped vortex loop. The attached ventral filaments of the loop subsequently slide along the length of the body and eventually fuse at the tip of the abdomen. We found no evidence for the shedding of wing-tip vorticity during the upstroke, and argue that this is due to an extreme form of the Wagner effect acting at that time. The flow visualizations predicted that maximum flight forces would be generated during the downstroke and ventral reversal, with little or no force generated during the upstroke. The instantaneous force measurements using laser-interferometry verified the periodic nature of force generation. Within each stroke cycle, there was one plateau of high force generation followed by a period of low force, which roughly correlated with the upstroke and downstroke periods. However, the fluctuations in force lagged behind their expected occurrence within the wing-stroke cycle by approximately 1 ms or one-fifth of the complete stroke cycle. This temporal discrepancy exceeds the range of expected inaccuracies and artifacts in the measurements, and we tentatively discuss the potential retarding effects within the underlying fluid mechanics.", "date": "1996", "authors": ["Michael H.

The virus has spread to at least 200 countries, and more than 1,700,000 confirmed cases and 111,600 deaths have been recorded, with massive global increases in the number of cases daily. Therefore, the WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, and chest pain with pneumonia in severe cases. In the beginning, the world public health authorities tried to eradicate the disease in China through quarantine but are now transitioning to prevention strategies worldwide to delay its spread. To date, there are no available vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs to treat the virus. There are many knowledge gaps about the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, leading to misinformation.

PCR efficiencies of amplicons are usually calculated from standard curves based on either known RNA inputs or on dilution series of a reference cDNA sample.

To assess the relevance of these findings for human disease, we performed virological and immunological studies in 18 individuals with H5N1 and 8 individuals infected with human influenza virus subtypes. Influenza H5N1 infection in humans is characterized by high pharyngeal virus loads and frequent detection of viral RNA in rectum and blood. Viral RNA in blood was present only in fatal H5N1 cases and was associated with higher pharyngeal viral loads. We observed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died, and these correlated with pharyngeal viral loads. Genetic characterization of H5N1 viruses revealed mutations in the viral polymerase complex associated with mammalian adaptation and virulence.

To analyze the single-crystal diffraction data collected with these detectors, several computer programs have been developed. Two-dimensional detectors and related software are now predominantly used to measure and integrate diffraction from single crystals of biological macromolecules. Macromolecular crystallography is an iterative process. To monitor the progress, the HKL package provides two tools: (1) statistics, both weighted (\u03c72) and unweighted (R-merge), where the Bayesian reasoning and multicomponent error model helps obtain proper error estimates and (2) visualization of the process, which helps an operator to confirm that the process of data reduction, including the resulting statistics, is correct and allows the evaluation of the problems for which there are no good statistical criteria. Visualization also provides confidence that the point of diminishing returns in data collection and reduction has been reached. At that point, the effort should be directed to solving the structure.

Methods Here we present a validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology. Results The workflow reliably detects 2019-nCoV, and further discriminates 2019-nCoV from SARS-CoV.

In the chemical DNA sequencing method, one end-labels the DNA, partially cleaves it at each of the four bases in four reactions, orders the products by size on a slab gel, and then reads the sequence from an autoradiogram by noting which base-specific agent cleaved at each successive nucleotide along the strand. This technique sequences the DNA made in and purified from cells. No enzymatic copying in vitro is required, and either single- or double-stranded DNA can be sequenced. Most chemical schemes that cleave at one or two of the four bases involve three consecutive steps: modification of a base, removal of the modified base from its sugar, and DNA strand scission at that sugar. Base-specific chemical cleavage is only one step in sequencing DNA. The chapter presents techniques for producing discrete DNA fragments, end-labeling DNA, segregating end-labeled fragments, extracting DNA from gels, and the protocols for partially cleaving it at specific bases using the chemical reactions.

Parallel concatenated schemes employing two convolutional codes as constituent codes, in connection with an iterative decoding algorithm of complexity comparable to that of the constituent codes, have been previously shown to yield remarkable coding gains close to theoretical limits. They have been named, and are known as, \"turbo codes\".

METHODS The protection levels of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (four models) and surgical masks (three models) were investigated while they were donned by 12 subjects performing the OSHA (US Occupational Safety and Health Administration) fit-testing exercises in a test chamber. RESULTS About 29% of N95 respirators and approximately 100% of surgical masks had PFs <10, which is the assigned PF designated for this type of respirator by the OSHA. On average, the PFs of N95 respirators were 8-12 times greater than those of surgical masks. The minimum PFs were observed in the size range of 0.04-0.2 mum. No significant difference in PF results was found between N95 respirators with and without an exhalation valve.

In the present study, the commercial grain refining practice of aluminium has been experimentally simulated by introducing synthetic TiB2 crystallites into melts by a specially developed technique. Experimental findings indicate that TiB2 crystallites alone do not nucleate \u03b1-Al. On the other hand, in the presence of dissolved Ti even below the peritectic level, an interfacial TiAl3 layer is formed at the TiB2/melt interface which subsequently nucleates the \u03b1-Al.

Classical approaches to the avoidance of ice formation through the imposition of ultra-rapid cooling and warming rates or by gradual depression of the equilibrium freezing point during cooling to -80 degrees C have not been adequate. An alternative approach relies on the ability of highly concentrated aqueous solutions of cryoprotective agents to supercool to very low temperatures.

Independence of the probability of occurrence of a new mutation's effect has been a fundamental premise in genetics. However, highly mutable contexts may be preserved by negative selection at important sites but destroyed by mutation at sites under no selection. Thus, there may be a positive correlation between the rate of mutations at a nucleotide site and the magnitude of their effect on fitness. We studied the impact of CpG context on the rate of human\u2013chimpanzee divergence and on intrahuman nucleotide diversity at non-synonymous coding sites. We compared nucleotides that occupy identical positions within codons of identical amino acids and only differ by being within versus outside CpG context. Nucleotides within CpG context are under a stronger negative selection, as revealed by their lower, proportionally to the mutation rate, rate of evolution and nucleotide diversity. In particular, the probability of fixation of a non-synonymous transition at a CpG site is two times lower than at a CpG site.

By means of a technique involving passive transfer of sera from animals given virus to recipient rabbits, the titer of circulating pyrogen was found to be closely correlated with the course of fever produced by virus. Certain properties of the pyrogen are described which differentiate it from the originally injected virus and suggest that the induced pyrogen is of endogenous origin. These properties resemble those of endogenous pyrogens occurring in other forms of experimental fever. The source of virus-induced pyrogen is unknown. In vitro incubation of virus with various constituents of the circulation did not result in the appearance of endogenous pyrogen. Granulocytopenia induced by HN2 failed to influence either fever or the production of endogenous pyrogen in rabbits injected with NDV. Similarly, the intraperitoneal inoculation of NDV into prepared exudates did not modify the febrile response. These findings do not lend support to the possibility that the polymorphonuclear leukocyte is a significant source of endogenous pyrogen in virus-induced fever.

Design. \u2014Prospective cohort study with a follow-up of 28 days or until discharge if earlier. Setting. \u2014Three intensive care units and three general wards in a tertiary health care institution. Methods. \u2014Patients were included if they met at least two of the criteria for SIRS: fever or hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, or abnormal white blood cell count. Main Outcomes Measures. \u2014Development of any stage of the biologic response to infection: sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, end-organ dysfunction, and death. Results. \u2014During the study period 3708 patients were admitted to the survey units, and 2527 (68%) met the criteria for SIRS. The incidence density rates for SIRS in the surgical, medical, and cardiovascular intensive care units were 857,804, and 542 episodes per 1000 patient-days, respectively, and 671,495, and 320 per 1000 patient-days for the medical, cardiothoracic, and general surgery wards, respectively. Among patients with SIRS, 649 (26%) developed sepsis, 467 (18%) developed severe sepsis, and 110 (4%) developed septic shock. The median interval from SIRS to sepsis was inversely correlated with the number of SIRS criteria (two, three, or all four) that the patients met. As the population of patients progressed from SIRS to septic shock, increasing proportions had adult respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, and shock. Positive blood cultures were found in 17% of patients with sepsis, in 25% with severe sepsis, and in 69% with septic shock. There were also stepwise increases in mortality rates in the hierarchy from SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock: 7%, 16%, 20%, and 46%, respectively. Of interest, we also observed equal numbers of patients who appeared to have sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock but who had negative cultures. They had been prescribed empirical antibiotics for a median of 3 days. The cause of the systemic inflammatory response in these culture-negative populations is unknown, but they had similar morbidity and mortality rates as the respective culture-positive populations.

Most often, these systems use input queues to hold packets waiting to traverse the switching fabric. It is well known that if simple first in first out (FIFO) input queues are used to hold packets then, even under benign conditions, head-of-line (HOL) blocking limits the achievable bandwidth to approximately 58.6% of the maximum. HOL blocking can be overcome by the use of virtual output queueing, which is described in this paper. A scheduling algorithm is used to configure the crossbar switch, deciding the order in which packets will be served. Previous results have shown that with a suitable scheduling algorithm, 100% throughput can be achieved. In this paper, we present a scheduling algorithm called iSLIP. An iterative, round-robin algorithm, iSLIP can achieve 100% throughput for uniform traffic, yet is simple to implement in hardware. Iterative and noniterative versions of the algorithms are presented, along with modified versions for prioritized traffic. Simulation results are presented to indicate the performance of iSLIP under benign and bursty traffic conditions. Prototype and commercial implementations of iSLIP exist in systems with aggregate bandwidths ranging from 50 to 500 Gb/s. When the traffic is nonuniform, iSLIP quickly adapts to a fair scheduling policy that is guaranteed never to starve an input queue. Finally, we describe the implementation complexity of iSLIP.

It has been previously shown to attenuate the course of fulminant hepatitis in mice produced by murine hepatitis virus strain 3. We therefore studied the effects of ribavirin on murine hepatitis virus strain 3 replication, macrophage production of proinflammatory mediators including TNF, IL-1, and the procoagulant activity (PCA), fgl2 prothrombinase; and Th1/Th2 cytokine production. Although ribavirin had inhibitory effects on viral replication (<1 log), even at high concentrations complete eradication of the virus was not seen. In contrast, at physiologic concentrations (up to 500 \u03bcg/ml), ribavirin markedly reduced viral-induced parameters of macrophage activation. With ribavirin treatment, the concentrations of PCA, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 all decreased to basal concentrations: PCA from 941 \u00b1 80 to 34 \u00b1 11 mU/106 cells; TNF-\u03b1 from 10.73 \u00b1 2.15 to 2.74 \u00b1 0.93 ng/ml; and IL-1\u03b2 from 155.91 \u00b1 22.62 to 5.74 \u00b1 0.70 pg/ml. The inhibitory effects of ribavirin were at the level of gene transcription as evidenced by Northern analysis. Both in vitro and in vivo, ribavirin inhibited the production of IL-4 by Th2 cells, whereas it did not diminish the production of IFN-\u03b3 in Th1 cells. In contrast, ribavirin had no inhibitory effect on TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 production in LPS-stimulated macrophages.

It allows continuous and categorical variables to be tested for and controlled for. The new method is valid despite the problem that phylogenetically close species tend to be similar, and is designed to be used when information about the phylogeny is incomplete. Information about the phylogeny of the species is assumed to be available in the form of a working phylogeny, which contains multiple nodes representing ignorance about the order of splitting of taxa. The non-independence between species is divided into that due to recognized phylogeny, that is, to phylogenetic associations represented in the working phylogeny; and that due to unrecognized phylogeny. The new method uses one linear contrast for each higher node in the working phylogeny, thus applying the \u2018radiation principle\u2019. For binary phylogenies the method is similar to an existing method. A criterion is suggested in the form of a simulation test for deciding on the acceptability of proposed statistical methods for analysing cross-species data with a continuous y-variable. This criterion is applied to the phylogenetic regression and to some other methods. The phylogenetic regression passes this test; the other methods tested fail it. Arbitrary choices have to be made about the covariance structure of the error in order to implement the method. It is argued that error results from omitted but relevant variables, and the implications for those arbitrary choices are discussed. One conclusion is that the dates of splits between taxa, even supplemented by rates of neutral gene evolution, do not provide the \u2018 true \u2019 covariance structure.

Naturally occurring sugar mimics with a nitrogen in the ring are classified into five structural classes: polyhydroxylated piperidines, pyrrolidines, indolizidines, pyrrolizidines and nortropanes. Glycosidases are involved in a wide range of important biological processes, such as intestinal digestion, post-translational processing of glycoproteins and the lysosomal catabolism of glycoconjugates. The realization that alkaloidal sugar mimics might have enormous therapeutic potential in many diseases such as viral infection, cancer and diabetes has led to increasing interest and demand for these compounds. Most of these effects can be shown to result from the direct or indirect inhibition of glycosidases. The glycosphingolipid (GSL) storage diseases are relatively rare hereditary disorders that are severe in nature and frequently fatal. Possible strategies for the treatment of these lysosomal storage diseases include enzyme replacement therapy, gene therapy and substrate deprivation. Recently, quite a new therapy for lysosomal storage diseases has been reported, namely a \u2018chemical chaperone therapy\u2019 for Fabry disease.

Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited. Objective We sought to evaluate the severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients. Results We identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission. Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan. The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period.

NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has revealed fascinating details of the surface of Pluto, including a vast ice-filled basin known as Sputnik Planum, which is central to Pluto's geological activity. Much of the surface of Sputnik Planum, consisting mostly of nitrogen ice, is divided into irregular polygons that are tens of kilometres in diameter and whose centres rise tens of metres above their sides. Two papers in this issue of Nature analyse New Horizons images of this polygonal terrain. Both conclude that it is continually being resurfaced by convection, but arrive at contrasting models for the process. Alexander Trowbridge et al. report a parameterized convection model in which the nitrogen ice is vigorously convecting, ten or more kilometres thick and about a million years old. William McKinnon et al. \u2014 from the New Horizons team \u2014 show that 'sluggish lid' convective overturn in a several-kilometre-thick layer of solid nitrogen can explain both the presence of the cells and their great width. The vast, deep, volatile-ice-filled basin informally named Sputnik Planum is central to Pluto\u2019s vigorous geological activity1,2. Composed of molecular nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices3, but dominated by nitrogen ice, this layer is organized into cells or polygons, typically about 10 to 40 kilometres across, that resemble the surface manifestation of solid-state convection1,2. Here we report, on the basis of available rheological measurements4, that solid layers of nitrogen ice with a thickness in excess of about one kilometre should undergo convection for estimated present-day heat-flow conditions on Pluto. More importantly, we show numerically that convective overturn in a several-kilometre-thick layer of solid nitrogen can explain the great lateral width of the cells. The temperature dependence of nitrogen-ice viscosity implies that the ice layer convects in the so-called sluggish lid regime5, a unique convective mode not previously definitively observed in the Solar System. Average surface horizontal velocities of a few centimetres a year imply surface transport or renewal times of about 500,000 years, well under the ten-million-year upper-limit crater retention age for Sputnik Planum2.

Passive transfer of high-titer polyclonal antibodies from vaccinated Ebola virus-immune cynomolgus macaques to naive macaques failed to confer protection against disease, suggesting a limited role of humoral immunity. In contrast, depletion of CD3(+) T cells in vivo after vaccination and immediately before challenge eliminated immunity in two vaccinated macaques, indicating a crucial requirement for T cells in this setting. The protective effect was mediated largely by CD8(+) cells, as depletion of CD8(+) cells in vivo using the cM-T807 monoclonal antibody (mAb), which does not affect CD4(+) T cell or humoral immune responses, abrogated protection in four out of five subjects.

For half a century, ZIKV was described only as causing sporadic human infections in Africa and Asia, which was mostly confirmed by serologic methods (2). In 2007, the first ZIKV outbreak reported outside Africa and Asia was retrospectively documented from biological samples of patients on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia, North Pacific, who had received an incorrect diagnosis of dengue virus (DENV) (3,4). We report here the early investigations that led to identification of ZIKV as the causative agent of an outbreak that started in October 2013 in French Polynesia. French Polynesia is a French overseas territory located in the South Pacific. The \u2248270,000 inhabitants live on 67 islands distributed into 5 archipelagoes (Society, Marquesas, Tuamotu, Gambier, and Austral Islands). Surveillance for acute febrile illnesses is coordinated by the Department of Health with the contribution of a sentinel network of public and private practitioners, the main public hospital (Centre Hospitalier du Taaone), and the public health and research institute (Institut Louis Malarde [ILM]). As part of this syndromic surveillance system, ILM has implemented protocols for detecting arboviruses that are known to cause outbreaks in French Polynesia, such as DENV, or that pose a risk for causing epidemics because of the presence of potential mosquito vectors. In addition, ILM provides DENV serotype identification for other Pacific island countries, including Yap State, as part of the regional surveillance of dengue (5). For that reason, a ZIKV reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) protocol by Lanciotti et al. (3) was implemented at ILM. In October 2013 (week 41), a 53-year-old women (patient 1) and 2 other members of the household\u2014her 52-year-old husband (patient 2) and her 42-year-old son-in-law (patient 3)\u2014experienced a mild dengue-like illness consisting of low fever (<38\u00b0C), asthenia, wrist and fingers arthralgia, headache, and rash. Patients 2 and 3 also had conjunctivitis. Patient 1 had swollen ankles and aphthous ulcers. For all 3 patients, results were negative for DENV by RT-PCR and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen tests (5), for West-Nile virus by RT-PCR, and for chikungunya virus by RT-PCR; results of RT-PCR for ZIKV were equivocal for patients 1 and 2. During week 43, a 57-year-old patient (patient 4) reported similar symptoms; results of RT-PCR for DENV were negative, but results of RT-PCR for ZIKV were positive. ZIKV infection was then confirmed by sequencing of the genomic position 858\u20131138 encompassing the prM/E protein coding regions of ZIKV (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"KJ579441\",\"term_id\":\"636632075\"}}KJ579441). The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of French Polynesia (reference no. 66/CEPF). Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence (Figure) showed ZIKV strain Cambodia 2010-FSS13025 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"JN860885\",\"term_id\":\"380036385\"}}JN860885) as the closest strain (6).

The evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum-likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa ... Concomitant with these investigations, the Department of Health recorded an increased number of patients with a mild dengue-like syndrome and rash who were visiting primary care physicians. Given this information, we performed RT-PCR for ZIKV on 10 samples collected during weeks 43 and 44 from patients living in different archipelagoes that had tested negative for DENV NS1 antigen. Four samples gave negative results; 4, positive; and 2, equivocal. Sequencing of 1 ZIKV-positive sample from a patient in Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"KJ579442\",\"term_id\":\"636632077\"}}KJ579442) showed that it had 100% homology with the fragment sequenced from patient 4 who lived in Tahiti, Society Islands. The phylogenetic tree shows that the ZIKV that recently emerged in French Polynesia is similar to Cambodia 2010 and Yap State 2007 strains, which corroborates previous findings of an expansion of ZIKV Asian lineage (7,8). ZIKV was then isolated by inoculating Vero cells with RT-PCR samples positive for ZIKV. After 6 days of propagation, ZIKV-infected cells were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay using specific hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluids provided by the Institut Pasteur (Dakar, Senegal) (9). By week 51, the practitioners\u2019 network recorded 5,895 patients with suspected ZIKV infections, leading to an estimate of 19,000 suspected cases when extrapolated to other care centers (adjusted to the mean consultation visits). Serum from 584 patients was tested by RT-PCR for ZIKV; 294 samples were positive. This ZIKV outbreak is the largest documented and the first known to be caused by an arbovirus other than DENV in French Polynesia. To assess when ZIKV circulation in French Polynesia might have started, we will be conducting a retrospective study on DENV NS1 antigen\u2013negative samples collected before the first ZIKV cases were detected. Investigations of the clinical features of ZIKV infections are ongoing.

While the RPB2 and 18S rDNA phylogenies were highly congruent, the RPB2 phylogeny did result in much higher bootstrap support for all the deeper branches within the orders and for several branches between orders of the Ascomycota. There are several strongly supported phylogenetic conclusions. The Ascomycota is composed of three major lineages: Archiascomycetes, Saccharomycetales, and Euascomycetes.

As it is computationally more expensive to solve multiclass problems, comparisons of these methods using large-scale problems have not been seriously conducted. Especially for methods solving multiclass SVM in one step, a much larger optimization problem is required so up to now experiments are limited to small data sets.

Computing the link capacity, associated with channel coding over multiple fading intervals, requires an optimization over the joint density of T/spl middot/M complex transmitted signals. We prove that there is no point in making the number of transmitter antennas greater than the length of the coherence interval: the capacity for M>T is equal to the capacity for M=T. Capacity is achieved when the T/spl times/M transmitted signal matrix is equal to the product of two statistically independent matrices: a T/spl times/T isotropically distributed unitary matrix times a certain T/spl times/M random matrix that is diagonal, real, and nonnegative.

Design. \u2014Prospective cohort study. Setting. \u2014Five US teaching hospitals between 1989 and 1994. Subjects. \u2014A total of 5735 critically ill adult patients receiving care in an ICU for 1 of 9 prespecified disease categories. Main Outcome Measures. \u2014Survival time, cost of care, intensity of care, and length of stay in the ICU and hospital, determined from the clinical record and from the National Death Index. A propensity score for RHC was constructed using multivariable logistic regression. Case-matching and multivariable regression modeling techniques were used to estimate the association of RHC with specific outcomes after adjusting for treatment selection using the propensity score. Sensitivity analysis was used to estimate the potential effect of an unidentified or missing covariate on the results. Results. \u2014By case-matching analysis, patients with RHC had an increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.49). The mean cost (25th, 50th, 75th percentiles) per hospital stay was $49300 ($17000, $30500, $56600) with RHC and $35700 ($11 300, $20600, $39200) without RHC. Mean length of stay in the ICU was 14.8 (5,9, 17) days with RHC and 13.0 (4,7, 14) days without RHC. These findings were all confirmed by multivariable modeling techniques. Subgroup analysis did not reveal any patient group or site for which RHC was associated with improved outcomes. Patients with higher baseline probability of surviving 2 months had the highest relative risk of death following RHC. Sensitivity analysis suggested that a missing covariate would have to increase the risk of death 6-fold and the risk of RHC 6-fold for a true beneficial effect of RHC to be misrepresented as harmful. Conclusion. \u2014In this observational study of critically ill patients, after adjustment for treatment selection bias, RHC was associated with increased mortality and increased utilization of resources. The cause of this apparent lack of benefit is unclear. The results of this analysis should be confirmed in other observational studies.

To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the community's progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges.", "date": "2014", "authors": ["Mark Everingham 1, S.

This report describes a multicenter clinical trial to assess clozapine's efficacy in the treatment of patients who are refractory to neuroleptics.DSM-IIIschizophrenics who had failed to respond to at least three different neuroleptics underwent a prospective, single-blind trial of haloperidol (mean dosage, 61 \u00b114 mg/d) for six weeks.

Two hundred sixty-eight patients were entered in the doubleblind comparison.

The soft-max rule employed is an extension of the standard K-means clustering procedure and takes into account a neighborhood ranking of the reference (weight) vectors. It is shown that the dynamics of the reference (weight) vectors during the input-driven adaptation procedure are determined by the gradient of an energy function whose shape can be modulated through a neighborhood determining parameter and resemble the dynamics of Brownian particles moving in a potential determined by the data point density.

Here, we report that genetically and antigenically distinct sublineages of H5N1 virus have become established in poultry in different geographical regions of Southeast Asia, indicating the long-term endemicity of the virus, and the isolation of H5N1 virus from apparently healthy migratory birds in southern China. Our data show that H5N1 influenza virus, has continued to spread from its established source in southern China to other regions through transport of poultry and bird migration. The identification of regionally distinct sublineages contributes to the understanding of the mechanism for the perpetuation and spread of H5N1, providing information that is directly relevant to control of the source of infection in poultry.

This report describes the complete genome sequence, genome organization, and expression strategy of HCoV-EMC/2012 and its relation with known coronaviruses. The genome contains 30,119 nucleotides and contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames, 9 of which are predicted to be expressed from a nested set of seven subgenomic mRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene of coronaviruses with completely sequenced genomes showed that HCoV-EMC/2012 is most closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (BtCoV-HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (BtCoV-HKU5), which prototype two species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus . In accordance with the guidelines of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and in view of the 75% and 77% amino acid sequence identity in 7 conserved replicase domains with BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, respectively, we propose that HCoV-EMC/2012 prototypes a novel species in the genus Betacoronavirus . HCoV-EMC/2012 may be most closely related to a coronavirus detected in Pipistrellus pipistrellus in The Netherlands, but because only a short sequence from the most conserved part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-encoding region of the genome was reported for this bat virus, its genetic distance from HCoV-EMC remains uncertain. HCoV-EMC/2012 is the sixth coronavirus known to infect humans and the first human virus within betacoronavirus lineage C. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are capable of infecting humans and many animal species. Most infections caused by human coronaviruses are relatively mild. However, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV in 2002 to 2003 and the fatal infection of a human by HCoV-EMC/2012 in 2012 show that coronaviruses are able to cause severe, sometimes fatal disease in humans. We have determined the complete genome of HCoV-EMC/2012 using an unbiased virus discovery approach involving next-generation sequencing techniques, which enabled subsequent state-of-the-art bioinformatics, phylogenetics, and taxonomic analyses. By establishing its complete genome sequence, HCoV-EMC/2012 was characterized as a new genotype which is closely related to bat coronaviruses that are distant from SARS-CoV.

The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water \u2013 the third key resource \u2013stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources. 2. Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages). 3. There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species. 4. Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up \u2013 fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates. 5. Synthesis.

We conducted an evaluation of CoV in rhinolophid and vespertilionid bat species common in Europe. Rhinolophids carried severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related CoV at high frequencies and concentrations (26% of animals are positive; up to 2.4\u00d710(8) copies per gram of feces), as well as two Alphacoronavirus clades, one novel and one related to the HKU2 clade. All three clades present in Miniopterus bats in China (HKU7, HKU8, and 1A related) were also present in European Miniopterus bats. An additional novel Alphacoronavirus clade (bat CoV [BtCoV]/BNM98-30) was detected in Nyctalus leisleri. A CoV grouping criterion was developed by comparing amino acid identities across an 816-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of all accepted mammalian CoV species (RdRp-based grouping units [RGU]). Criteria for defining separate RGU in mammalian CoV were a >4.8% amino acid distance for alphacoronaviruses and a >6.3% distance for betacoronaviruses. All the above-mentioned novel clades represented independent RGU. Strict associations between CoV RGU and host bat genera were confirmed for six independent RGU represented simultaneously in China and Europe. A SARS-related virus (BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008) from a Rhinolophus blasii (Rhi bla) bat was fully sequenced. It is predicted that proteins 3b and 6 were highly divergent from those proteins in all known SARS-related CoV. Open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was surprisingly absent. Surface expression of spike and staining with sera of SARS survivors suggested low antigenic overlap with SARS CoV. However, the receptor binding domain of SARS CoV showed higher similarity with that of BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008 than with that of any Chinese bat-borne CoV.

However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior.

Additions of Al-Ti-B master alloys were made both below and above the peritectic concentration in reference to the Al-rich corner of the binary Al-Ti phase diagram (0.15 pct Ti in solution). The experiments were conducted at various times after the addition of grain refiner. From the results, except for formation of TiB2, no effect of boron on the Al-rich portion of the binary Al-Ti phase diagram can be observed. With hypoperitectic additions of Al-Ti-B master alloys, TiB2 particles are the most frequent nucleant for aluminum grains. Also, when Al-5Ti-lB additions are made, nucleation frequently occurs above the equilibrium liquidus temperature. From a thermodynamic point of view, this phenomenon can occur only if regions of the melt (which contain bondes and nucleate new grains) have a higher Ti concentration than is present in the bulk of the liquid. A mechanism has been proposed to account for this observation. When hyperperitectic additions of grain refiner were made, a metastable formation of Al solid was often observed to occur at 2 to 5 deg above the equilibrium peritectic temperature. Other researchers have made this observation and proposed that a metastable aluminide phase was formed, even though no X-ray evidence of this phase was found.

Congenital microcephaly is associated with genetic factors and several causative agents. Epidemiological data suggest that microcephaly cases in Brazil might be associated with the introduction of Zika virus. We aimed to detect and sequence the Zika virus genome in amniotic fluid samples of two pregnant women in Brazil whose fetuses were diagnosed with microcephaly. Methods In this case study, amniotic fluid samples from two pregnant women from the state of Paraiba in Brazil whose fetuses had been diagnosed with microcephaly were obtained, on the recommendation of the Brazilian health authorities, by ultrasound-guided transabdominal amniocentesis at 28 weeks' gestation. The women had presented at 18 weeks' and 10 weeks' gestation, respectively, with clinical manifestations that could have been symptoms of Zika virus infection, including fever, myalgia, and rash. After the amniotic fluid samples were centrifuged, DNA and RNA were extracted from the purified virus particles before the viral genome was identified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic reconstruction and investigation of recombination events were done by comparing the Brazilian Zika virus genome with sequences from other Zika strains and from flaviviruses that occur in similar regions in Brazil. Findings We detected the Zika virus genome in the amniotic fluid of both pregnant women. The virus was not detected in their urine or serum. Tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Toxoplasma gondii , rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, HIV, Treponema pallidum , and parvovirus B19 were all negative. After sequencing of the complete genome of the Brazilian Zika virus isolated from patient 1, phylogenetic analyses showed that the virus shares 97\u2013100% of its genomic identity with lineages isolated during an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013, and that in both envelope and NS5 genomic regions, it clustered with sequences from North and South America, southeast Asia, and the Pacific. After assessing the possibility of recombination events between the Zika virus and other flaviviruses, we ruled out the hypothesis that the Brazilian Zika virus genome is a recombinant strain with other mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Interpretation These findings strengthen the putative association between Zika virus and cases of microcephaly in neonates in Brazil. Moreover, our results suggest that the virus can cross the placental barrier. As a result, Zika virus should be considered as a potential infectious agent for human fetuses. Pathogenesis studies that confirm the tropism of Zika virus for neuronal cells are warranted.

Here we present the use of such a technique for the inoculation of mice with a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope DNA construct (pM160). Mice were injected intramuscularly with pM160 and were subsequently analyzed for their anti-HIV envelope immune responses. Antisera collected from inoculated animals reacted with the recombinant HIV-1 envelope in ELISA and immunoprecipitation assays. The antisera also contained antibodies that were able to neutralize HIV-1 infection and inhibit HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation in vitro. Furthermore, splenic lymphocytes derived from pM160-inoculated animals demonstrated HIV-envelope-specific proliferative responses.

Tethered flying Drosophila actively modulate the timing of these rapid supinations during yaw responses evoked by an oscillating visual stimulus. The time difference between the two wings is controlled such that the wing on the outside of a fictive turn rotates in advance of its contralateral partner. This modulation of ventral-flip timing between the two wings is strongly coupled with changes in wing-stroke amplitude. Typically, an increase in the stroke amplitude of one wing is correlated with an advance in the timing of the ventral flip of the same wing. However, flies do display a limited ability to control these two behaviors independently, as shown by flight records in which the correlation between ventral-flip timing and stroke amplitude transiently reverses. The control of ventral-flip timing may be part of an unsteady aerodynamic mechanism that enables the fly to alter the magnitude and direction of flight forces during turning maneuvers.", "date": "1993", "authors": ["Michael H.

In clinical practice, antiviral use has rarely been guided by antecedent laboratory diagnosis. Defined clinical predictors of an influenza infection can help guide timely therapy and avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. Objective: To examine which clinical signs and symptoms are most predictive of influenza infection in patients with influenzalike illness using a large data set derived from clinical trials of zanamivir. Methods: This analysis is a retrospective, pooled analysis of baseline signs and symptoms from phase 2 and 3 clinical trial participants. It was conducted in mainly unvaccinated (mean age, 35 years) adults and adolescents who had influenzalike illness, defined as having fever or feverishness plus at least 2 of the following influenzalike symptoms: headache, myalgia, cough, or sore throat who underwent laboratory testing for influenza. Clinical signs and symptoms were evaluated in statistical models to identify those best predicting laboratory confirmation of influenza. Results: Of 3744 subjects enrolled with baseline influenzalike symptoms, and included in this analysis, 2470 (66%) were confirmed to have influenza. Individuals with influenza were more likely to have cough (93% vs 80%), fever (68% vs 40%), cough and fever together (64% vs 33%), and/or nasal congestion (91% vs 81%) than those without influenza. The best multivariate predictors of influenza infections were cough and fever with a positive predictive value of 79% (P,.001). The positive predictive value rose with the increase in the temperature at the time of recruitment. Conclusion: When influenza is circulating within the community, patients with an influenzalike illness who have both cough and fever within 48 hours of symptom onset are likely to have influenza and the administration of influenza antiviral therapy may be appropriate to consider.

Several smoothing methods for maximum entropy models have been proposed to address this problem, but previous results do not make it clear how these smoothing methods compare with smoothing methods for other types of related models. In this work, we survey previous work in maximum entropy smoothing and compare the performance of several of these algorithms with conventional techniques for smoothing n-gram language models. Because of the mature body of research in n-gram model smoothing and the close connection between maximum entropy and conventional n-gram models, this domain is well-suited to gauge the performance of maximum entropy smoothing methods. Over a large number of data sets, we find that an ME smoothing method proposed to us by Lafferty performs as well as or better than all other algorithms under consideration.

Clin Chem 2003;49:396\u2013406). The technique required a fluorescently labeled primer and was limited to the detection of mutations residing in the melting domain of the labeled primer. Our aim was to develop a closed-tube system for genotyping and mutation scanning that did not require labeled oligonucleotides. Methods: We studied polymorphisms in the hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A) gene (T102C), \u03b2-globin (hemoglobins S and C) gene, and cystic fibrosis (F508del, F508C, I507del) gene. PCR was performed in the presence of the double-stranded DNA dye LCGreen, and high-resolution amplicon melting curves were obtained. After fluorescence normalization, temperature adjustment, and/or difference analysis, sequence alterations were distinguished by curve shape and/or position. Heterozygous DNA was identified by the low-temperature melting of heteroduplexes not observed with other dyes commonly used in real-time PCR. Results: The six common \u03b2-globin genotypes (AA, AS, AC, SS, CC, and SC) were all distinguished in a 110-bp amplicon. The HTR2A single-nucleotide polymorphism was genotyped in a 544-bp fragment that split into two melting domains. Because melting curve acquisition required only 1\u20132 min, amplification and analysis were achieved in 10\u201320 min with rapid cycling conditions. Conclusions: High-resolution melting analysis of PCR products amplified in the presence of LCGreen can identify both heterozygous and homozygous sequence variants. The technique requires only the usual unlabeled primers and a generic double-stranded DNA dye added before PCR for amplicon genotyping, and is a promising method for mutation screening.", "date": "2003", "authors": ["Carl T.

A number of components of this model are developed in further detail and implemented as computer algorithms. At the highest level, a verification process has been developed which can determine exact values of viewpoint and object parameters from hypothesized matches between three-dimensional object features and two-dimensional image features. This provides a reliable quantitative procedure for evaluating the correctness of an interpretation, even in the presence of noise or occlusion. Given a reliable method for final evaluation of correspondence, the remaining components of the system are aimed at reducing the size of the search space which must be covered. Unlike many previous approaches, this recognition process does not assume that it is possible to directly derive depth information from the image. Instead, the primary descriptive component is a process of perceptual organization, in which spatial relations are detected directly among two-dimensional image features. A basic requirement of the recognition process is that perceptual organization should accurately distinguish meaningful groupings from those which arise by accident of viewpoint or position. This requirement is used to derive a number of further constraints which must be satisfied by algorithms for perceptual grouping. A specific algorithm is presented for the problem of segmenting curves into natural descriptions. Methods are also presented for using the viewpoint-invariance properties of the perceptual groupings to infer three-dimensional relations directly from the image. The search process itself is described, both for covering the range of possible viewpoints and the range of possible objects. A method is presented for using evidential reasoning to combine information from multiple sources to determine the most efficient ordering for the search. This use of evidential reasoning allows a system to automatically improve its performance as it gains visual experience.

As with other publications, the reporting quality of systematic reviews varies, limiting readers' ability to assess the strengths and weaknesses of those reviews. Several early studies evaluated the quality of review reports. In 1987, Mulrow examined 50 review articles published in 4 leading medical journals in 1985 and 1986 and found that none met all 8 explicit scientific criteria, such as a quality assessment of included studies.5 In 1987, Sacks and colleagues6 evaluated the adequacy of reporting of 83 meta-analyses on 23 characteristics in 6 domains. Reporting was generally poor; between 1 and 14 characteristics were adequately reported (mean\u200a=\u200a7.7; standard deviation\u200a=\u200a2.7). A 1996 update of this study found little improvement.7 In 1996, to address the suboptimal reporting of meta-analyses, an international group developed a guidance called the QUOROM Statement (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses), which focused on the reporting of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials.8 In this article, we summarize a revision of these guidelines, renamed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses), which have been updated to address several conceptual and practical advances in the science of systematic reviews (Box 1).

Data are especially sparse in the intermediate Reynolds number regime (10<Re<1000) appropriate for the flight of small insects. This paper attempts to fill this deficit by quantifying the time-dependence of aerodynamic forces for a simple yet important motion, rapid acceleration from rest to a constant velocity at a fixed angle of attack. The study couples the measurement of lift and drag on a two-dimensional model with simultaneous flow visualization. The results of these experiments are summarized below. 1. At angles of attack below 13.5\u00b0, there was virtually no evidence of a delay in the generation of lift, in contrast to similar studies made at higher Reynolds numbers. 2. At angles of attack above 13.5\u00b0, impulsive movement resulted in the production of a leading edge vortex that stayed attached to the wing for the first 2 chord lengths of travel, resulting in an 80 % increase in lift compared to the performance measured 5 chord lengths later. It is argued that this increase is due to the process of detached vortex lift, analogous to the method of force production in delta-wing aircraft. 3. As the initial leading edge vortex is shed from the wing, a second vortex of opposite vorticity develops from the trailing edge of the wing, correlating with a decrease in lift production. This pattern of alternating leading and trailing edge vortices generates a von Karman street, which is stable for at least 7.5 chord lengths of travel. 4. Throughout the first 7.5 chords of travel the model wing exhibits a broad lift plateau at angles of attack up to 54\u00b0, which is not significantly altered by the addition of wing camber or surface projections. 5. Taken together, these results indicate how the unsteady process of vortex generation at large angles of attack might contribute to the production of aerodynamic forces in insect flight. Because the fly wing typically moves only 2\u20134 chord lengths each half-stroke, the complex dynamic behavior of impulsively started wing profiles is more appropriate for models of insect flight than are steady-state approximations.", "date": "1992", "authors": ["Michael H.

In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x).

Possible explanations for the observed phenomena are outlined, drawing on known cellular processes in Drosophila, fungi, and mammals as well as plants. It is hypothesized that duplicated sequences can, under certain circumstances, become involved in cycles of hybrid chromatin formation or other processes that generate the potential for modification of inherited chromatin structure and cytosine methylation patterns. These epigenetic changes could lead to altered transcription rates or altered efficiencies of mRNA maturation and export from the nucleus. Where the loss of gene expression is posttranscriptional, antisense RNA could be formed on accumulated, inefficiently processed RNAs by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or from a chromosomal promoter and cause the observed loss of homologous mRNAs and possibly the modification of homologous genes.

The predicted protein sequence consists of 805 amino acids, including a potential 17-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide sequence and a putative C-terminal membrane anchor. Expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells of a soluble, truncated form of ACEH, lacking the transmembrane and cytosolic domains, produces a glycoprotein of 120 kDa, which is able to cleave angiotensin I and angiotensin II but not bradykinin or Hip-His-Leu. In the hydrolysis of the angiotensins, ACEH functions exclusively as a carboxypeptidase. ACEH activity is inhibited by EDTA but not by classical ACE inhibitors such as captopril, lisinopril, or enalaprilat. Identification of the genomic sequence of ACEH has shown that the ACEH gene contains 18 exons, of which several have considerable size similarity with the first 17 exons of human ACE.

To define analytically such a relationship would be highly desirable but diversity of variable involved makes this task extremely complicated. Our efforts focus on examination of that complex mapping and investigation of the influence of the various parameters on CCT. The evaluation of CCT involves elaborate computations that often include time-consuming solutions of nonlinear on-fault system equations. Existing conventional pattern recognition techniques are incapable of synthesizing such complex and transparent mappings. Thus, when a human operator tells the machine learning unit (that is the pattern recognizer) that system state belongs to a certain class, say \"emergency\", the pattern recognizer merely records that classification mindlessly and is not able to look at the pattern with insight and discover what underlies the \"emergency\" nature of pattern.

Significant variation in the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is described mainly for animals, but also for unicells and plants. Much of this variation, which can be related to taxonomic, physiological, and/or environmental differences, is not adequately explained by existing theoretical models, which are also reviewed. As a result, synthetic explanatory schemes based on multiple boundary constraints and on the scaling of multiple energy-using processes are advocated. It is also stressed that a complete understanding of metabolic scaling will require the identification of both proximate (functional) and ultimate (evolutionary) causes. Four major types of intraspecific metabolic scaling with body mass are recognized [based on the power function R=aMb, where R is respiration (metabolic) rate, a is a constant, M is body mass, and b is the scaling exponent]: Type I: linear, negatively allometric (b 1) to one or two later phases of negative allometry (b<1). Ontogenetic changes in the metabolic intensity of four component processes (i.e. growth, reproduction, locomotion, and heat production) appear to be important in these different patterns of metabolic scaling. These changes may, in turn, be shaped by age (size)-specific patterns of mortality. In addition, major differences in interspecific metabolic scaling are described, especially with respect to mode of temperature regulation, body-size range, and activity level. A 'metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis' focusing on two major constraints (surface-area limits on resource/waste exchange processes and mass/volume limits on power production) can explain much, but not all of this variation. My analysis indicates that further empirical and theoretical work is needed to understand fully the physiological and ecological bases for the considerable variation in metabolic scaling that is observed both within and among species. Recommended approaches for doing this are discussed.

In this paper, we examine the basic building block of cooperative diversity systems, a simple fading relay channel where the source, destination, and relay terminals are each equipped with single antenna transceivers. We consider three different time-division multiple-access-based cooperative protocols that vary the degree of broadcasting and receive collision. The relay terminal operates in either the amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) modes. For each protocol, we study the ergodic and outage capacity behavior (assuming Gaussian code books) under the AF and DF modes of relaying. We analyze the spatial diversity performance of the various protocols and find that full spatial diversity (second-order in this case) is achieved by certain protocols provided that appropriate power control is employed. Our analysis unifies previous results reported in the literature and establishes the superiority (both from a capacity, as well as a diversity point-of-view) of a new protocol proposed in this paper. The second part of the paper is devoted to (distributed) space-time code design for fading relay channels operating in the AF mode. We show that the corresponding code design criteria consist of the traditional rank and determinant criteria for the case of colocated antennas, as well as appropriate power control rules. Consequently space-time codes designed for the case of colocated multiantenna channels can be used to realize cooperative diversity provided that appropriate power control is employed.", "date": "2004", "authors": ["R.U.

Adequate animal models are required to study the underlying pathogenesis of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection and to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics. We report the first findings of measurable clinical disease in nonhuman primates (NHPs) infected with SARS-CoV. Methods and Findings In order to characterize clinically relevant parameters of SARS-CoV infection in NHPs, we infected cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV in three groups: Group I was infected in the nares and bronchus, group II in the nares and conjunctiva, and group III intravenously. Nonhuman primates in groups I and II developed mild to moderate symptomatic illness. All NHPs demonstrated evidence of viral replication and developed neutralizing antibodies. Chest radiographs from several animals in groups I and II revealed unifocal or multifocal pneumonia that peaked between days 8 and 10 postinfection. Clinical laboratory tests were not significantly changed. Overall, inoculation by a mucosal route produced more prominent disease than did intravenous inoculation. Half of the group I animals were infected with a recombinant infectious clone SARS-CoV derived from the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. This infectious clone produced disease indistinguishable from wild-type Urbani strain.

Considerable advances have since been made into the pathobiology (changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation), management, and epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination. Objective To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock. Process A task force (n\u2009=\u200919) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement (by 31 societies listed in the Acknowledgment). Key Findings From Evidence Synthesis Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis was redundant. Recommendations Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%. Septic shock should be defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as being more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least 2 of the following clinical criteria that together constitute a new bedside clinical score termed quickSOFA (qSOFA): respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less. Conclusions and Relevance These updated definitions and clinical criteria should replace previous definitions, offer greater consistency for epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing sepsis.", "date": "2016", "authors": ["Mervyn Singer 1, Clifford S.

Based on amino acid composition and NH2- and COOH-terminal sequence analysis p12, pp18, p30, and p10 are distinct from one another, whereas pp20 is likely identical to pp18 in primary structure. The p12 was resistant to Edman degradation and was found to be myristylated at the NH2-terminal amino group. Sequence comparisons among the retrovirus family show that pp18/pp20 and p10 are, respectively, homologs of phospho-proteins and nucleic acid-binding proteins. A comparison of terminal sequences with the nucleotide sequence of spleen necrosis virus (SNV) revealed that the gag genes of SNV and REV-A are highly conserved; together with the identification of REV-A gag-precursor polyprotein, Pr60gag in immunoprecipitates of radiolabeled cell lysates, this comparison also led to the establishment of the organization of Pr60gag, viz., NH2-p12-pp18-p30-p10-OH. Sequence comparisons show that REV-A/SNV is related to mammalian type C viruses: the pp18-p30 region is most homologous to the macaque/colobus group and least to simian sarcoma virus (SSV), whereas both the 5'- and 3'-gag regions (i.e., p12 and p10) are clostest to SSV. Immunological studies using monospecific antisera and Western-blot analysis showed that antigenic determinants of REV-A p30 are conserved in most of mammalian type C and type D viruses, but those of REV-A p12 are shared only with simian sarcoma-associated virus (SSAV) and endogenous viruses of macaques.", "date": "1985", "authors": ["Wen-Po Tsai , Terry D.

This survey aims to provide a general, comprehensive, and structured overview of the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection in data represented as graphs.

The increase in flight force above that required to support body weight is accompanied by a rise in wing velocity, brought about by an increase in stroke amplitude and a decrease in stroke frequency. Inertial costs, although greater than either profile or induced power, would be minimal with even modest amounts of elastic storage, and total mechanical power energy should be equivalent to aerodynamic power alone. Because of the large profile drag expected at low Reynolds numbers, the profile power was approximately twice the induced power at all levels of force generation. Thus, it is the cost of overcoming drag, and not the production of lift, that is the primary requirement for flight in Drosophila melanogaster.

We have found previously that bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae can be isolated from the nasopharyngeal secretions of a substantial proportion of adults with upper-respiratory-tract infections. We have assessed the efficacy of co-amoxiclav in patients with common colds but no clinical signs of sinusitis or other indications for antibiotics. Methods Between January, 1992, and March, 1994, 314 patients who presented to our outpatient clinic with common colds were enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. They were randomly assigned 5 days' treatment with co-amoxiclav (375 mg three times daily) or identical placebo. Clinical examinations were done at enrolment and on day 5-7 to assess outcome (cured, persistent symptoms, worse symptoms). Seven patients were excluded after randomisation, seven did not have nasopharyngeal aspiration, and 12 did not return for follow-up assessment. Findings Of 300 patients with nasopharyngeal aspirates, 72 had negative bacterial cultures, 167 had cultures positive only for bacteria unrelated to respiratory infections, and 61 had cultures positive for H influenzae, M catarrhalis, or S pneumoniae . At 5-day follow-up of these culture-positive patients, the distribution of outcome was significantly better among co-amoxiclav-treated (n=30) than placebo-treated (n=28) patients (cured 27 vs 4%; persistent symptoms 70 vs 60%; worse symptoms 3 vs 36%; p=0\u00b7001). Patients on co-amoxiclav also scored their symptoms significantly lower than patients on placebo (p=0\u00b7008). Among culture-negative patients (n=230), the outcome distribution did not differ between the treatment groups (p=0\u00b7392).

Inactivated vaccine should be given yearly to all of those over the age of 65, as well as younger individuals with high-risk medical conditions and individuals delivering care to such persons.

The PVX-resistant plants accumulated the RdRp protein at a lower level than fully susceptible plants transformed with the same RdRp construct. In this paper the difference between the PVX-resistant and susceptible transformed plants is investigated and it is demonstrated that there are three associated phenotypes of the RdRp transgene that vary in parallel between transformed lines. These phenotypes are: accumulation of the transgenic RdRp RNA at a low level; strain-specific resistance to PVX; and the ability of the transgene to trans-inactivate homologous transgenes. This gene-silencing potential of the transgenes conferring PVX resistance was illustrated by analysis of progeny from a cross between a transformant that was extremely resistant to PVX and a second PVX-susceptible transformant. In other transformants, in which the resistance was less extreme, the same three phenotypes were associated but in a transgene dosage-dependent manner. The same association of strain-specific resistance and low-level accumulation of the transgenic RdRp RNA was observed with plants that were transformed with mutant or wild-type versions of the RdRp gene. Strain-specific resistance was also produced in plants transformed with untranslatable versions of the RdRp transgene. Based on these data it is proposed that homology-dependent gene silencing and transgenic resistance to PVX may be due to the same RNA-based mechanism. An undefined genomic feature is proposed to account for the variation in the resistance and trans-inactivation phenotypes of different transformants. It is further proposed that this genome feature influences a cytoplasmic mechanism that degrades RNA with sequence homology to the silencing transgene.", "date": "1995", "authors": ["Elisabeth Mueller , Julie Gilbert , Guy Davenport , Gianinna Brigneti , David C.

Water, the only liquid which was used, filled the annular space between two concentric cylinders of radii a and b (b > a)to a depth of d cm. depth of d cm. The cylinders were maintained at different temperatures MATHS FORMULA. The general properties of the flow depend on the value of a certain parameter \u0398 \u2261 2 g d [ \u03c1 ( T a ) \u2212 \u03c1 ( T b ) ] / \u03a9 2 ( b \u2212 a ) 2 [ \u03c1 ( T b ) + \u03c1 ( T a ) ] where g is the acceleration of gravity and p(T) is the density of water at temperature T. re T. When 0 exceeds a certain value,O the flow is essentially a meridional circulation, in which the motion perpendicular to the axis of rotation is deflected by Coriolis forces. When 0 is somewhat less than O. the flow is characterized by a regular quasi-horizontal wave-like pattern in which the motion is almost but not entirely confined to a thin meandering \u2018jet\u2019 stream. The transition between these two regimes of flow takes place quite sharply when 0 = 0 Crit. = 1*58 +- 0*05. The train of waves in the wave-flow regime drifts relative to the rotating system at a uniform angular rate, in the same general direction as that of the flow in the top surface \u2018jet \u2019 stream. The wave number m increases as 0 decreases, until a certain point is reached, corresponding to an amplitude to wavelength ratio of about two-thirds, when no further increase in m can be produced by reducing 0. At this point a steady repeating fluctuation of the flow pattern occurs. This phenomenon has been termed \u2018vacillation\u2019. At even smaller values of 0 the flow is \u2018turbulent\u2019 in the sense that rapid and complicated fluctuations occur. These flow phenomena appear to have their counterparts in the general atmospheric circulation. Specific investigations are described, including heat transport measurements and a study of the thermal structure of a typical flow field. Theoretical considerations lead to an interpretation of the meaning of 0, which is tentatively identified with appropriate Rossby and Richardson numbers, and some of the results of theories due to Davies (1956) and Kuo (1953) are compared with the experimental measurements.

The greatest effect is probe quenching by hybridization to amplicons containing deoxyguanosine nucleotides (Gs), giving a sequence-specific decrease in fluorescence as product accumulates. Quenching of the probes by Gs is position dependent. A 25% decrease in fluorescence of 5'-labeled probes was observed with a G at the first position of the 3'-dangling end. Additional Gs can increase quenching to about 40%. This change in fluorescence with hybridization allows real-time quantification and mutation detection with a simple single labeled probe. Quantification of the initial template copy number is possible by monitoring fluorescence at each cycle at a constant temperature. Mutation detection by Tm estimates from melting curve analysis for factor V Leiden, hemoglobin C, hemoglobin S, the thermolabile mutation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, and the cystic fibrosis-associated deletion F508del is demonstrated.

Since that time, serologic studies and virus isolations have demonstrated that the virus has a wide geographic distribution, including eastern and western Africa; the Indian subcontinent; Southeast Asia; and most recently, Micronesia (2\u20135). The virus is transmitted primarily through the bite of infected mosquitoes and most likely is maintained in a zoonotic cycle involving nonhuman primates (1), although recent evidence suggests the possibility of occasional sexual transmission in humans (4). Few case reports have described the clinical characteristics of ZIKV infection in humans. Most reports describe a self-limiting febrile illness that could easily be mistaken for another arboviral infection, such as dengue or chikungunya fever. We report a confirmed case of ZIKV infection in Cambodia. Since 2006, the US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2 (NAMRU-2) has conducted surveillance for acute fever to determine causes of the infection among patients who seek health care at local clinics in Cambodia. Patients were enrolled by the health clinic physician after they gave informed consent in accordance with an institutional review board protocol approved by NAMRU-2 and the National Ethics Committee for Human Research of Cambodia. At enrollment, the physician administered a questionnaire and collected specimens (blood and throat swabs). All items were transported to the NAMRU-2 laboratory in Phnom Penh, where testing was conducted for a variety of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens. In August 2010, a blood specimen was collected from a 3-year-old boy at a health clinic in Kampong Speu Province, Cambodia. The child\u2019s reported clinical symptoms included 4 days of fever and sore throat and cough and a headache for 3 days. A maculopapular rash was not observed, and the boy was not hospitalized. The clinic staff conducted a follow-up interview and reported that the patient recovered fully. ZIKV infection was confirmed in this patient by using PCR, sequencing, and serology and through virus isolation. ELISA for chikungunya and dengue virus IgM and IgG antibodies on acute- and convalescent-phase serum was negative. A universal flavivirus real-time PCR screen that targets the nonstructural (NS) 5 gene (6) determined that the patient\u2019s serum was positive for flavivirus RNA, but subsequent species-specific PCR ruled out 2 other flaviviruses that are highly endemic to the region (dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses) (7\u20139). This result was the first nondengue, non\u2013Japanese encephalitis virus flavivirus detected after samples from \u224810,000 enrolled patients were tested. Nucleic acid sequencing of the amplicon isolated by gel purification produced a 100-bp fragment with 100% sequence identity to ZIKV (nucleotide position 8,969 of the NS5 gene of the isolate GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"EU545988\",\"term_id\":\"189092757\"}}EU545988). ZIKV infection subsequently was serologically confirmed by hemagglutination-inhibition tests on paired serum samples. The patient\u2019s acute-phase sample was negative, but a convalescent-phase sample gave a positive reaction with ZIKV antigen to a serum dilution of 1:320 and was negative to antigens for the 4 dengue serotypes and yellow fever and West Nile viruses. These results demonstrate that the patient had a clear monotypic flavivirus immune response with seroconversion against ZIKV, indicating a recent primary infection. The most common signs and symptoms reported in confirmed ZIKV infections are fever, headache, malaise, maculopapular rash, fatigue or myalgia, and arthritis and arthralgia (Table). In addition to fever and headache, the patient in this study had a sore throat and cough. Because of the patient\u2019s age, additional information about symptoms was difficult to obtain. Table Reported or observed clinical signs and symptoms in persons with Zika virus infection, 1962\u20132010 The clinical characteristics exhibited by this case-patient are similar to those of shown in a small cluster of ZIKV infections described in Indonesia during 1977\u20131978 in which maculopapular rash was not observed (5). Maculopapular rash was reported as a common sign in case-patients from the recent Yap Island outbreak (3), as well as in case reports from Uganda (2), Senegal, and the United States (4), A case report of laboratory-acquired ZIKV infection also noted the lack of maculopapular rash (10). The clinical features of ZIKV infection are similar to those of dengue virus and chikungunya virus infections, and both arboviruses are found in Southeast Asia. In this region, laboratory-based confirmation is essential. The extent of ZIKV infections in Cambodia is unknown; further studies are needed to clarify the prevalence and geographic distribution of ZIKV infection in the country.", "date": "2012", "authors": ["Vireak Heang 1, Chadwick Y.

We have overcome the limitations of this approach, leveraging the use of antibody from nonhuman primates (NHPs) that survived challenge to filoviruses under controlled conditions. By using concentrated, polyclonal IgG antibody from these survivors, we treated filovirus-infected NHPs with multiple doses administered over the clinical phase of disease. In the first study, Marburg virus (MARV)-infected NHPs were treated 15 to 30 min postexposure with virus-specific IgG, with additional treatments on days 4 and 8 postexposure. The postexposure IgG treatment was completely protective, with no signs of disease or detectable viremia. MARV-specific IgM antibody responses were generated, and all macaques survived rechallenge with MARV, suggesting that they generated an immune response to virus replication. In the next set of studies, NHPs were infected with MARV or Ebola virus (EBOV), and treatments were delayed 48 h, with additional treatments on days 4 and 8 postexposure. The delayed treatments protected both MARV- and EBOV-challenged NHPs. In both studies, two of the three IgG-treated NHPs had no clinical signs of illness, with the third NHP developing mild and delayed signs of disease followed by full recovery.

A rubber lip was used on the rotating disk to remove any film from previous depositions.

Some of these are largely ecological changes, and all have important ecological consequences. Three of the well\u2014documented global changes are: increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; alterations in the biogeochemistry of the global nitrogen cycle; and ongoing land use/land cover change. Human activity\u2013now primarily fossil fuel combustion\u2013 has increased carbon dioxide concentrations from \u00b0280 to 355 mL/L since 1800; the increase is unique, at least in the past 160 000 yr, and several lines of evidence demonstrate unequivocally that it is human\u2014caused. This increase is likely to have climatic consequences\u2013and certainly it has direct effects on biota in all Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. The global nitrogen cycle has been altered by human activity to such an extent that more nitrogen is fixed annually by humanity (primarily for nitrogen fertilizer, also by legume crops and as a by product of fossil fuel combustion) than by all natural pathways combined. This added nitrogen alters the chemistry of the atmosphere and of aquatic ecosystems, contributes to eutrophiction of the biosphere, and has substantial regional effects on biological diversity in the most affected areas. Finally, human land use/land cover change has transformed one\u2014their to one\u2014half of Earth's ice\u2014free surface. This in and of itself probably represents the most important component of global change now and will for some decades to come; it has profound effects on biological diversity on land and on ecosystems downwind and downstream of affected areas. Overall, any clear dichotomy between pristine ecosystems and human\u2014altered areas that may have existed in the past has vanished, and ecological research should account for this reality. These three and other equally certain components of global environmental change are the primary causes of anticipated changes in climate, and of ongoing losses of biological diversity. They are caused in turn by the extraordinary growth in size and resource use of the human population. On a broad scale, there is little uncertainty about any of these components of change or their causes.

In applications such as microsatellites and underwater vehicles, formations have the potential for greater functionality and versatility than individual vehicles. In this thesis, we investigate two topics relevant to control of vehicle formations: optimal vehicle control and cooperative control. The framework of optimal control is often employed to generate vehicle trajectories. We use tools from geometric mechanics to specialize the two classical approaches to optimal control, namely the calculus of variations and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, to the case of vehicle dynamics. We employ the formalism of the covariant derivative, useful in geometric representations of vehicle dynamics, to relate variations of position to variations of velocity. When variations are computed in this setting, the evolution of the adjoint variables is shown to be governed by the covariant derivative, thus inheriting the geometric structure of the vehicle dynamics. To simplify the HJB equation, we develop the concept of time scalability enjoyed by many vehicle systems. We employ this property to eliminate time from the HJB equation, yielding a purely spatial PDE whose solution supplies both finite-time optimal trajectories and a time-invariant stabilizing control law. Cooperation among vehicles in formation depends on intervehicle communication. However, vehicle communication is often subject to disruption, especially in an adversarial setting. We apply tools from graph theory to relate the topology of the communication network to formation stability. We prove a Nyquist criterionthat uses the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix to determine the effect of the graph on formation stability. We also propose a method for decentralized information exchange between vehicles. This approach realizes a dynamical system that supplies each vehicle with a common reference to be used for cooperative motion. We prove a separation principle that states that formation stability is achieved if the information flow is stable for the given graph and if the local controller stabilizes the vehicle. The information flow can be rendered highly robust to changes in the graph, thus enabling tight formation control despite limitations in intervehicle communication capability.", "date": "2001", "authors": ["Joseph Alexander Fax"], "related_topics": ["Vehicle dynamics", "Optimal control", "Separation principle", "Graph theory", "Laplacian matrix", "Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation", "Geometric mechanics", "Scalability", "Control theory", "Mathematics"], "citation_count": "191", "reference_count": "79", "references": ["1578099820", "2611515161", "2128969277", "1588998206", "2130647945", "2147928602", "1524590822", "1964373008", "2073787051", "2152849761"]}, {"id": "2170005346", "title": "Regulated expression of three C/EBP isoforms during adipose conversion of 3T3-L1 cells.", "abstract": "In an effort to identify protein factors that play a regulatory role in the differentiation of adipocytes, we have isolated two genes that encode polypeptides related to CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP; hereafter termed C/EBP alpha).

Furthermore, C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta readily form heterodimers with one another as well as with C/EBP alpha. The transcriptional activating capacity of these two newly identified C/EBP isoforms was demonstrated by transient transfection experiments in which expression vectors encoding C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta were observed to induce transcription from the promoter of the serum albumin gene in cultured hepatoma cells. The mRNAs encoding C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta were detected in a number of tissues, most of which corresponded to sites of expression of C/EBP alpha. The expression pattern of C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta during adipose conversion of 3T3-L1 cells was examined by Western and Northern blotting assays. In contrast to the expression profile of the gene encoding C/EBP alpha, whose product is not detectable until the late phase of adipocyte differentiation, the c/ebp beta and c/ebp delta genes were actively expressed very early during adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, transcription of the c/ebp beta and c/ebp delta genes was observed to be induced directly by adipogenic hormones. The accumulation of C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta reached a maximal level during the first 2 days of differentiation and declined sharply before the onset of C/EBP alpha accumulation.

We argue that the data augmentation schemes should preserve intrinsic structures and attributes of graphs, which will force the model to learn representations that are insensitive to perturbation on unimportant nodes and edges. However, most existing methods adopt uniform data augmentation schemes, like uniformly dropping edges and uniformly shuffling features, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive representation learning method with adaptive augmentation that incorporates various priors for topological and semantic aspects of the graph. Specifically, on the topology level, we design augmentation schemes based on node centrality measures to highlight important connective structures. On the node attribute level, we corrupt node features by adding more noise to unimportant node features, to enforce the model to recognize underlying semantic information. We perform extensive experiments of node classification on a variety of real-world datasets.

NKSF/IL-12 mediates pleiomorphic biological activity on T and NK cells and, alone or in synergy with other inducers, is a powerful stimulator of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production. IL-10 is a potent inhibitor of monocyte-macrophage activation, that inhibits production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1 and also IFN-gamma from lymphocytes acting at the level of accessory cells. Because TNF-alpha and IL-1 are not efficient inducers of IFN-gamma, the mechanism by which IL-10 inhibits IFN-gamma production is not clear. In this paper, we show that IL-10 is a potent inhibitor of NKSF/IL-12 production from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated with Staphylococcus aureus or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both the production of the free NKSF/IL-12 p40 chain and the biologically active p70 heterodimer are blocked by IL-10. NKSF/IL-12 p40 chain mRNA accumulation is strongly induced by S. aureus or LPS and downregulated by IL-10, whereas the p35 mRNA is constitutively expressed and only minimally regulated by S. aureus, LPS, or IL-10. Although IL-10 is able to block the production of NKSF/IL-12, a powerful inducer of IFN-gamma both in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism of inhibition of IFN-gamma by IL-10 cannot be explained only on the basis of inhibition of NKSF/IL-12 because IL-10 can partially inhibit IFN-gamma production induced by NKSF/IL-12, and also, the IFN-gamma production in response to various stimuli in the presence of neutralizing antibodies to NKSF/IL-12. Our findings that antibodies against NKSF/IL-12, TNF-alpha, or IL-1 beta can significantly inhibit IFN-gamma production in response to various stimuli and that NKSF/IL-12 and IL-1 beta can overcome the IL-10-mediated inhibition of IFN-gamma, suggest that IL-10 inhibition of IFN-gamma production is primarily due to its blocking production from accessory cells of the IFN-gamma-inducer NKSF/IL-12, as well as the costimulating molecule IL-1 beta.", "date": "1993", "authors": ["A.

Statistical analyses suggest that discontinuities associated with instrumental errors are large for many high-latitude station records, although they are unlikely to be significant for the majority of the stations. The first leading EOF in global precipitation fields is an ENSO-related pattern, concentrating mostly in the low latitudes. The second leading EOF depicts a linear increasing trend (;2.4 mm decade21) in global precipitation fields during the period of 1900\u201088. Consistent with the zonal precipitation trends identified in previous analyses, the EOF trend is seen as a long-term increase mostly in North America, mid- to high-latitude Eurasia, Argentina, and Australia. The spatial patterns of the trend EOF and the rate of increase are generally consistent with those of the precipitation changes in increasing CO 2 GCM experiments. The North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) accounts for ;10% of December\u2010February precipitation variance over North Atlantic surrounding regions. The mode suggests that during high-NAO-index winters, precipitation is above normal in northern (.508N) Europe, the eastern United States, northern Africa, and the Mediterranean, while below-normal precipitation occurs in southern Europe, eastern Canada, and western Greenland. Wet and dry months of one standard deviation occur at probabilities close to those of a normal distribution in midlatitudes. In the subtropics, the mean interval between two extreme events is longer. The monthly wet and dry events seldom (probability , 5%) last longer than 2 months. ENSO is the single largest cause of global extreme precipitation events. Consistent with the upward trend in global precipitation, globally, the averaged mean interval between two dry months increased by ;28% from 1900\u201044 to 1945\u201088. The percentage of wet areas over the United States has more than doubled (from ;12% to .24%) since the 1970s, while the percentage of dry areas has decreased by a similar amount since the 1940s.

At low AMF diversity, the plant species composition and overall structure of microcosms that simulate European calcareous grassland fluctuate greatly when the AMF taxa that are present are changed. Plant biodiversity, nutrient capture and productivity in macrocosms that simulate North American old-fields increase significantly with increasing AMF-species richness.

Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete--i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the gastrointestinal symptoms and other clinical parameters of the first 138 patients with confirmed SARS admitted for a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003 was performed. Intestinal specimens were obtained by colonoscopy or postmortem examination to detect the presence of coronavirus by electron microscopy, virus culture, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Among these 138 patients with SARS, 28 (20.3%) presented with watery diarrhea and up to 38.4% of patients had symptoms of diarrhea during the course of illness. Diarrhea was more frequently observed during the first week of illness. The mean number of days with diarrhea was 3.7 \u00b1 2.7, and most diarrhea was self-limiting. Intestinal biopsy specimens obtained by colonoscopy or autopsy showed minimal architectural disruption but the presence of active viral replication within both the small and large intestine. Coronavirus was also isolated by culture from these specimens, and SARS-CoV RNA can be detected in the stool of patients for more than 10 weeks after symptom onset.

Less certain is the precise rate at which the two quantities vary. Classical theory derived from simple geometry suggests that if mass increases by a given amount, metabolism increases by two-thirds as much. However, much recent work points to a scaling exponent of around three-quarters. This has opened up an enormous front of research and debate, and into the fray step Reich et al. who, in an unprecedentedly comprehensive survey of plant metabolism, overturn the whole notion of allometric scaling. Metabolism in plants varies not allometrically but isometrically, in one-to-one step with changing mass. This underlines fundamental differences between animals and plants, with plants controlled largely by biochemistry and animals largely by vascular networks. The scaling of respiratory metabolism to body size in animals is considered to be a fundamental law of nature1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, and there is substantial evidence for an approximate -power relation. Studies suggest that plant respiratory metabolism also scales as the -power of mass12,13,14, and that higher plant and animal scaling follow similar rules owing to the predominance of fractal-like transport networks and associated allometric scaling8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here, however, using data obtained from about 500 laboratory and field-grown plants from 43 species and four experiments, we show that whole-plant respiration rate scales approximately isometrically (scaling exponent \u2248 1) with total plant mass in individual experiments and has no common relation across all data. Moreover, consistent with theories about biochemically based physiological scaling15,16,17,18, isometric scaling of whole-plant respiration rate to total nitrogen content is observed within and across all data sets, with a single relation common to all data. This isometric scaling is unaffected by growth conditions including variation in light, nitrogen availability, temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration, and is similar within or among species or functional groups.

On each recursion, the algorithm successively partitions an interval of the number line between 0 and 1, and retains one of the partitions as the new interval. Thus, the algorithm successively deals with smaller intervals, and the code string, viewed as a magnitude, lies in each of the nested intervals. The data string is recovered by using magnitude comparisons on the code string to recreate how the encoder must have successively partitioned and retained each nested subinterval.

Patients were included if they had fever, a known exposure to SARS, and respiratory symptoms or infiltrates observed on chest radiograph. Patients were excluded if an alternative diagnosis was determined.Main Outcome MeasuresLocation of exposure to SARS; features of the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests at admission to the hospital; and 21-day outcomes such as death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission with or without mechanical ventilation.ResultsOf the 144 patients, 111 (77%) were exposed to SARS in the hospital setting. Features of the clinical examination most commonly found in these patients at admission were self-reported fever (99%), documented elevated temperature (85%), nonproductive cough (69%), myalgia (49%), and dyspnea (42%). Common laboratory features included elevated lactate dehydrogenase (87%), hypocalcemia (60%), and lymphopenia (54%). Only 2% of patients had rhinorrhea. A total of 126 patients (88%) were treated with ribavirin, although its use was associated with significant toxicity, including hemolysis (in 76%) and decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL (in 49%). Twenty-nine patients (20%) were admitted to the ICU with or without mechanical ventilation, and 8 patients died (21-day mortality, 6.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9%-11.8%). Multivariable analysis showed that the presence of diabetes (relative risk [RR], 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-7.2; P = .01) or other comorbid conditions (RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.8; P = .03) were independently associated with poor outcome (death, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation).ConclusionsThe majority of cases in the SARS outbreak in the greater Toronto area were related to hospital exposure. In the event that contact history becomes unreliable, several features of the clinical presentation will be useful in raising the suspicion of SARS. Although SARS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with diabetes or other comorbid conditions, the vast majority (93.5%) of patients in our cohort survived.Published online May 6, 2003 (doi:10.1001/jama.289.21.JOC30885).", "date": "2003", "authors": ["Christopher M.

Lindley (1968) emphasized that the method to be employed in any analysis should be related to the use intended for the finally fitted regression. In the report by Beale et al. (1967), the emphasis is on selecting the best subset for any specified number of retained independent variables. Here we will be concerned with pointing out the advantages of the variable selection scheme in which independent variables are successively discarded one at a time from the original full set. While these advantages are not unknown to workers in this field, they are however not appreciated by the statistical community in general. For the purposes of this demonstration it is assumed that we are in the nonsingular case so that the number of observations exceeds the number of regressor variables. Let us begin by considering economy of effort. Suppose that we were using a step-up regression procedure, ignoring for the while its theoretical deficiencies (to be discussed later). We should then first fit k simple regressions, one for each of the k regressor variables considered, selecting the single most significant individual regressor variable. Having made this selection we would proceed with k - 1 additional fits to determine which of the remaining variables in conjunction with the first selected yielded the greatest reduction in residual variation. This process is continued on so as to provide a successive selection and ordering of variables. We may even require the ordering of all k variables, leaving for later decision what critical juncture is to be employed in determining which of the k variables to retain, which to reject-if we do so we shall have made a total of k(k + 1)/2 fits, albeit they may have differed greatly in their degree of complexity. A complete stepdown regression procedure however requires but k fits, as will now be indicated. Suppose we have done a multiple regression on all k variables and wish to consider the k possible multiple regressions on all sets of k - 1 variables, that is where 1 variable has been deleted. The results for these k possible multiple regressions are implicit in the initial k-variable regression, provided we have secured the inverse matrix, or at least its diagonal, necessary for testing the significance of the fitted partial regression coefficients.

The 12patients all had severedyspnea, tachypnea, cyanosis that was refractory to oxygen therapy, decreased respiratory system compliance, and diffuse alveolar infiltrations on their chest radiographs. Pathologic examination in seven patients who died revealed atelectasis, vascular congestion and hemorrhage, severe pulmonary edema and hyaline membranes. Shortly afterward, Petty and coworkers (2), called this constellation of findings the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since then, ARDS has been recognized as an entity throughout the world and has been the subject of numerous conferences, hundreds of articles, and several books. As a result of this activity, much descriptive information has been obtained about ARDS, and we have learned a lot about its clinical features, physiologic disturbances, prognosis, and pathologic findings. And yet formidable problems remain: there is disagreement about exactly what ARDS is and on what causes it; more importantly, available empiric treatment is inadequate, and mortality remains unacceptably high (600/0 or more) (3). This appears to be one of the few points of agreement among investigators, but even that statement is arguable (4). We believe that much of the controversy concerning ARDS is explained by the lack of a satisfactory definition of this elusivesyndrome. How can you collect, much less compare, epidemiologicdata and mortality figures when there is no uniformly accepted (and used) definition?

His purpose is to construct a principle theory of natural grammar that is directly compatible with both expalantory linguistic accounts of a number of problematic syntactic phenomena and a straightforward computational account of the way sentences are mapped onto represenations of meaning. The radical nature of Steedman's proposal stems from his claim that much of the apparent complexity of syntax, prosody and processing follows from the lexical specification of the grammar and from the involvement of a small number of universal rule-types for combining predicates and arguments. These syntactic operations are related to the combinators of Combinatory Logic, engendering a much freer definition of derivational constituency than is traditionally assumed.

Following the trail blazed by my eminent predecessors, Dr. Jay P. Sanford and Dr. Theodore C. Eickhoff, is challenging and humbling. I have taken as my theme the interwoven myths and realities of infection control practice because I believe the new discipline of hospital infection control is at a delicate point in its development. Over the past decade the importance of identifying and controlling nosocomial infections has received wide recognition. A cadre of dedicated practitioners has been trained and employed? as this large, energetic organization attests. And the re sults of the SENIC Project (Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control) will be available soon. Thus, our discipline has available both trained people and a reservoir of information. Our progress during the coming decade will be measured by how successfully we act on the basis of what we know; the emphasis will be on control. The word \"myth\" could be defined in two ways: (1) a belief given uncritical acceptance by a group, especially in support of traditional practices; or (2) a notion held to be true but without factual basis. It might be useful to examine four notions held rather commonly by infection controllers?notions that I believe are mythical. Wide spread belief in them obstructs recognition of reality and, in doing so, obstructs progress in infection control. Because these notions are widely held, I suspect that what I am about to say will be provocative; certainly all of you will not agree with me.

The predominant vector system for such work is the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) system. Despite the success of YACs, many problems have been described including: chimerism, tedious steps in library construction and low yields of YAC insert DNA. Recently a new E.coli based system has been developed, the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system, which offers many potential advantages over YACs. We tested the BAC system in plants by constructing an ordered 13,440 clone sorghum BAC library. The library has a combined average insert size, from single and double size selections, of 157 kb. Sorghum inserts of up to 315 kb were isolated and shown to be stable when grown for over 100 generations in liquid media. No chimeric clones were detected as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization of ten BAC clones to metaphase and interphase S.bicolor nuclei. The library was screened with six sorghum probes and three maize probes and all but one sorghum probe hybridized to at least one BAC clone in the library. To facilitate chromosome walking with the BAC system, methods were developed to isolate the proximal ends of restriction fragments inserted into the BAC vector and used to isolate both the left and right ends of six randomly selected BAC clones. These results demonstrate that the S. bicolor BAC library will be useful for several physical mapping and map-based cloning applications not only in sorghum but other related cereal genomes, such as maize. Furthermore, we conclude that the BAC system is suitable for most large genome applications, is more 'user friendly' than the YAC system, and will likely lead to rapid progress in cloning biologically significant genes from plants.", "date": "1994", "authors": ["Sung sick Woo 1, Jiming Jiang 1, 2, Bikram S.

This virus had been detected in six provinces and municipal cities in China as of April 18, 2013. We correlated genomic sequences from avian influenza viruses with ecological information and did phylogenetic and coalescent analyses to extrapolate the potential origins of the virus and possible routes of reassortment events. Methods We downloaded H7N9 virus genome sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database and public sequences used from the Influenza Virus Resource. We constructed phylogenetic trees and did 1000 bootstrap replicates for each tree. Two rounds of phylogenetic analyses were done. We used at least 100 closely related sequences for each gene to infer the overall topology, removed suspicious sequences from the trees, and focused on the closest clades to the novel H7N9 viruses. We compared our tree topologies with those from a bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST) analysis. We used the bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method to jointly estimate phylogenies, divergence times, and other evolutionary parameters for all eight gene fragments. We used sequence alignment and homology-modelling methods to study specific mutations regarding phenotypes, specifically addressing the human receptor binding properties. Findings The novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus originated from multiple reassortment events. The HA gene might have originated from avian influenza viruses of duck origin, and the NA gene might have transferred from migratory birds infected with avian influenza viruses along the east Asian flyway. The six internal genes of this virus probably originated from two different groups of H9N2 avian influenza viruses, which were isolated from chickens. Detailed analyses also showed that ducks and chickens probably acted as the intermediate hosts leading to the emergence of this virulent H7N9 virus. Genotypic and potential phenotypic differences imply that the isolates causing this outbreak form two separate subclades. Interpretation The novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus might have evolved from at least four origins.

It caused an epidemic of critical illness and some patients developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). OBJECTIVES To describe the characteristics of all patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1)-associated ARDS treated with ECMO and to report incidence, resource utilization, and patient outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS An observational study of all patients (n = 68) with 2009 influenza A(H1N1)-associated ARDS treated with ECMO in 15 intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia and New Zealand between June 1 and August 31, 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence, clinical features, degree of pulmonary dysfunction, technical characteristics, duration of ECMO, complications, and survival. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients with severe influenza-associated ARDS were treated with ECMO, of whom 61 had either confirmed 2009 influenza A(H1N1) (n = 53) or influenza A not subtyped (n = 8), representing an incidence rate of 2.6 ECMO cases per million population. An additional 133 patients with influenza A received mechanical ventilation but no ECMO in the same ICUs. The 68 patients who received ECMO had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 34.4 (26.6-43.1) years and 34 patients (50%) were men. Before ECMO, patients had severe respiratory failure despite advanced mechanical ventilatory support with a median (IQR) Pao(2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2)) ratio of 56 (48-63), positive end-expiratory pressure of 18 (15-20) cm H(2)O, and an acute lung injury score of 3.8 (3.5-4.0). The median (IQR) duration of ECMO support was 10 (7-15) days. At the time of reporting, 48 of the 68 patients (71%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 60%-82%) had survived to ICU discharge, of whom 32 had survived to hospital discharge and 16 remained as hospital inpatients. Fourteen patients (21%; 95% CI, 11%-30%) had died and 6 remained in the ICU, 2 of whom were still receiving ECMO. CONCLUSIONS During June to August 2009 in Australia and New Zealand, the ICUs at regional referral centers provided mechanical ventilation for many patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1)-associated respiratory failure, one-third of whom received ECMO.

The goal of image coding is to reduce this number, as much as possible, and reconstruct a faithful duplicate of the original picture. Early efforts in image coding, solely guided by information theory, led to a plethora of methods. The compression ratio, starting at 1 with the first digital picture in the early 1960s, reached a saturation level around 10:1 a couple of years ago. This certainly does not mean that the upper bound given by the entropy of the source has also been reached. First, this entropy is not known and depends heavily on the model used for the source, i.e., the digital image. Second, the information theory does not take into account what the human eye sees and how it sees. Recent progress in the study of the brain mechanism of vision has opened new vistas in picture coding. Directional sensitivity of the neurones in the visual pathway combined with the separate processing of contours and textures has led to a new class of coding methods capable of achieving compression ratios as high as 70:1. Image quality, of course, remains as an important problem to be investigated. This class of methods, that we call second generation, is the subject of this paper. Two groups can be formed in this class: methods using local operators and combining their output in a suitable way and methods using contour-texture descriptions. Four methods, two in each class, are described in detail. They are applied to the same set of original pictures to allow a fair comparison of the quality in the decoded pictures.

In particular, we explicitly show the effects of modifications made to the short-time transform (both fixed and time-varying modifications are considered) on the resulting signal and discuss applications where each of the techniques would be most useful The interesting case of nonlinear modifications (possibly signal dependent) to the short-time Fourier transform is also discussed. Finally it is shown that a formal duality exists between the two synthesis methods based on the properties of the window used for obtaining the short-time Fourier transform.", "date": "1977", "authors": ["J.B.

There may have been times when developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body of theoretical results: results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual insights of the field; results that squeeze all possible implications out of those insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them.", "date": "1986", "authors": ["P.

We designed a prospective cohort study to define the incidence and risk factors for late CMV infection in patients who undergo HSCT. CMV-seropositive patients were studied prospectively for CMV infection (quantitative pp65 antigenemia, quantitative CMV-DNA, blood culture), T-cell immunity (CMV-specific CD4+ T-helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, CD4 and CD8 T-cell count, absolute lymphocyte count), and other transplantation-related factors. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to assess the risk for late CMV infection and disease and to assess overall survival. Late CMV disease developed in 26 of 146 (17.8%) patients a median of 169 days after transplantation (range, 96-784 days); the mortality rate was 46%. Thirty-eight percent of patients surviving late disease had a second episode a median of 79 days after the first episode. At 3 months after transplantation, preceding detection of CMV pp65 antigenemia, CD4 T-cell counts lower than 50 cells/mm3, postengraftment absolute lymphopenia levels lower than 100 lymphocytes/mm3, undetectable CMV-specific T-cell responses, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were associated with late CMV disease or death. After 3 months, continued detection of pp65 antigenemia or CMV DNA in plasma or peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphopenia (fewer than 300 lymphocytes/mm3) were strong predictors of late CMV disease and death. In conclusion, CMV viral load, lymphopenia, and CMV-specific T-cell immunodeficiency are predictors of late CMV disease and death after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

In order to accelerate recognition considerably, the model groups can be arranged in an index space (hashed) offline such that feasible matches are found by indexing into this space. For the case of 2D images and 3D models consisting of point features, bounds on the space required for indexing and on the speedup that such indexing can achieve are demonstrated. It is proved that, even in the absence of image error, each model must be represented by a 2D surface in the index space. This places an unexpected lower bound on the space required to implement indexing and proves that no quantity is invariant for all projections of a model into the image. Theoretical bounds on the speedup achieved by indexing in the presence of image error are also determined, and an implementation of indexing for measuring this speedup empirically is presented. It is found that indexing can produce only a minimal speedup on its own. However, when accompanied by a grouping operation, indexing can provide significant speedups that grow exponentially with the number of features in the groups. >", "date": "1991", "authors": ["D.T.

Cardiac myosins undergo an adult-to-fetal isoform transition in various models of hypertrophy. Using gene-specific cDNA probes, we show here that in the adult myocardium the mRNAs encoding the fetal (skeletal muscle type) isoforms of alpha-actin and sarcomeric tropomyosin are re-expressed within 2 days in response to pressure overload. In addition, atrial natriuretic factor mRNA, so far believed to be expressed primarily in the atria, was readily detectable in the ventricles of neonates and was induced to markedly high levels in pressure-overloaded adult ventricles. In contrast, cardiac hypertrophy produced by thyroid hormone excess was not associated with induction of the atrial natriuretic factor gene or fetal contractile protein isogenes. Furthermore, the c-fos and c-myc protooncogenes and a major heat shock protein gene (hsp70) are induced in the ventricular myocardium within 1 hr after imposition of pressure overload. These results suggest that induction of cellular protooncogenes and heat shock (stress) protein genes is an early response to pressure overload, whereas reinduction of the genes normally expressed only in perinatal life, such as fetal isoforms of contractile proteins and atrial natriuretic factor, is a later event.

We assayed 28 Mb (190 kb in 148 alleles) of genomic sequence, comprising the 5\u00b4 and 3\u00b4 untranslated regions (UTRs), introns and coding sequence of these genes, for sequence differences in individuals of African and Northern European descent using high-density variant detection arrays (VDAs).

The SNPs detected have an average minor allele frequency of 11%, and 387 are within the coding sequence (cSNPs). Of all cSNPs, 54% lead to a predicted change in the protein sequence, implying a high level of human protein diversity.

Under some natural probability measure on the set of objects, the measure of the subset of objects having the given property is either 0 or 1. In the latter case we can say that almost all the objects have the property. Familiar examples of this phenomenon are the following: almost all real numbers are transcendental (or normal to every base), almost all integers are composite, almost all continuous real functions are nondifferentiable, etc. It is often the case that the objects under consideration can be partitioned into a countable number of finite classes Cn, with the probability assigned to an object in Cn being just 1/ICn I. In this case, we say that a property Pn satisfies a 0-1 law if the fraction of the number of objects in Cn that satisfy Pn either tends to 0 or tends to 1 as n -x 0o. For example, almost all graphs on n vertices have maximum cliques and maximum independent sets of size at most 2 log n, almost all Boolean functions with n variables have circuit complexity (1 + o( 1 ))2n and almost all binary codes of length n with at most 2nR codewords (with R less than the binary symmetric channel capacity C) have arbitrarily small error probability (a special case of Shannon's coding theorem; see [S48]). One of the first general results of this type was the theorem of Fagin [F76] and Glebskii et al. [GKLT69], which asserts that every property of graphs that can be expressed in first-order logic satisfies a 0-1 law (see [SS88] for recent striking developments in this topic). One obvious method for finding explicit objects having some property Pn shared by almost all objects in Cn is simply to select one at random. With overwhelming probability (tending to 1 as n -x oc), the selected object will have property Pn. Unfortunately, it may be (and often is) extremely difficult to prove that any particular object does indeed satisfy Pn . It is our purpose in this paper to describe a method that can to a certain extent circumvent this difficulty. We will show that, for a variety of families, it is possible to identify a natural hierarchy of equivalence classes of properties, all of which are shared by almost all objects in the family.

The protein, named Kaede, includes a tripeptide, His-Tyr-Gly, that acts as a green chromophore that can be converted to red. The red fluorescence is comparable in intensity to the green and is stable under usual aerobic conditions. We found that the green-red conversion is highly sensitive to irradiation with UV or violet light (350\u2013400 nm), which excites the protonated form of the chromophore. The excitation lights used to elicit red and green fluorescence do not induce photoconversion. Under a conventional epifluorescence microscope, Kaede protein expressed in HeLa cells turned red in a graded fashion in response to UV illumination; maximal illumination resulted in a 2,000-fold increase in the ratio of red-to-green signal. These color-changing properties provide a simple and powerful technique for regional optical marking. A focused UV pulse creates an instantaneous plane source of red Kaede within the cytosol. The red spot spreads rapidly throughout the cytosol, indicating its free diffusibility in the compartment. The extensive diffusion allows us to delineate a single neuron in a dense culture, where processes originating from many different somata are present.

To identify novel vaccine carriers suitable for vaccine delivery in humans, we isolated and sequenced more than 1000 adenovirus strains from chimpanzees (ChAd).

In this paper, four multiobjective EAs are compared quantitatively where an extended 0/1 knapsack problem is taken as a basis.

It is characterized by (a) storing nondominated solutions externally in a second, continuously updated population, (b) evaluating an individual's fitness dependent on the number of external nondominated points that dominate it, (c) preserving population diversity using the Pareto dominance relationship, and (d) incorporating a clustering procedure in order to reduce the nondominated set without destroying its characteristics. The proof-of-principle results obtained on two artificial problems as well as a larger problem, the synthesis of a digital hardware-software multiprocessor system, suggest that SPEA can be very effective in sampling from along the entire Pareto-optimal front and distributing the generated solutions over the tradeoff surface.

It has been suggested that CRRT has several advantages over IRRT including better haemodynamic stability, lower mortality and higher renal recovery rates. Objectives To compare CRRT with IRRT to establish if any of these techniques is superior to each other in patients with ARF. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Authors of included studies were contacted, reference lists of identified studies and relevant narrative reviews were screened. Search date: October 2006. Selection criteria RCTs comparing CRRT with IRRT in adult patients with ARF and reporting prespecified outcomes of interest were included. Studies assessing CAPD were excluded. Data collection and analysis Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We identified 15 studies (1550 patients). CRRT did not differ from IRRT with respect to in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12), ICU mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.26), number of surviving patients not requiring RRT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.07), haemodynamic instability (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.28) or hypotension (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.16) and need for escalation of pressor therapy (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.08). Patients on CRRT were likely to have significantly higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) (MD 5.35, 95% CI 1.41 to 9.29) and higher risk of clotting dialysis filters (RR, 95% CI 8.50 CI 1.14 to 63.33). Authors' conclusions In patients who are haemodynamically stable, the RRT modality does not appear to influence important patient outcomes, and therefore the preference for CRRT over IRRT in such patients does not appear justified in the light of available evidence.

This study investigated the effect of car traffic on the breeding density of birds in deciduous and coniferous woodland, and the importance of noise and visibility of cars as possible factors affecting density. 2. Of the 43 species analysed in both woodland types, 26 species (60%) showed evidence of reduced density adjacent to roads (based on analysis with Wilcoxon signed-ranks test and regression). 3. Regression models with noise load as the only independent variable gave the best overall results. Calculated \u00abeffect distances\u00bb (the distance from the road up to where a reduced density was present) based on these regressions varied between species from 40-1500 m for a road with 10 000 cars per day to 70-2800 m for a road with 60 000 cars per day (120 km h \u22121 and 70% amount of woodland along the road). For a zone of 250 m from the road the reduction of the density varied from 20 to 98%. 4. When visibility of cars was controlled for, the number of species showing density reductions was much higher on plots with a high noise load than on ones with a low noise load. When noise conditions were held constant, however, there was no difference in bird densities between plots with high and low visibility of cars. 5. It is argued that noise load is probably the most important cause of the reduced densities. Visibility of cars, direct mortality and pollution are considered unimportant. 6.

It is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a reemerging viral hemorrhagic fever, which accounts for significant human morbidity in regions of endemicity in western Africa, with approximately 300,000 to 500,000 infections occurring each year (20). An estimated 30% of infections are symptomatic, and the clinical picture ranges from flu-like illness to fulminant hemorrhagic fever with an overall mortality of 10 to 15% (19). Humans recover from acute Lassa fever in the absence of a measurable neutralizing (N) antibody response (12). Low-titer N antibodies develop only late in convalescence (9, 28) and preferentially neutralize Lassa virus strains isolated in the same geographical region (9). Their role in protection from reinfection is presently not clear. Lassa virus reinfections presumably occur without clinically overt disease, as suggested by prospective seroprevalence studies in areas of endemicity (20). However, more clinical and virological data on this issue are needed. Attempts to vaccinate against Lassa fever in animal models, including nonhuman primates, have revealed that eliciting a strong cellular immune response protects from clinical disease, but not from infection, in the absence of measurable N antibodies (reviewed in reference 4). Even after challenge the animals developed only a very low-titer N antibody response. It was shown in the guinea pig model that infection with heterologous arenaviruses of low pathogenicity confers protection against challenge with highly virulent Lassa virus strains (10). This immunity could be passed on to naive animals only by syngeneic transfer of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) obtained in the early phase of convalescence. Evidence for an important role for CD4+ cells in protection comes from an experiment in which vaccination of mice with recombinant vaccinia virus-Lassa virus constructs elicited a response consisting of CD4+ CTLs, which protected the animals from infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), in the absence of N antibodies (16). The role of Lassa virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ cells has to date not been evaluated in human disease. As cellular immunity is associated with recovery in the natural course of Lassa fever and is essential in the setting of experimental vaccines, we were interested in investigating T-cell responses of persons from areas of endemicity who were exposed to the virus. Because the structural proteins from Lassa virus strains differ by up to 10 to 15% in their amino acid sequences, with only the strains Josiah (JOS) and Nigeria (NIG) having been sequenced completely to date, we placed a special emphasis on the question of whether naturally acquired immunity was cross-protective against different Lassa virus strains.", "date": "2000", "authors": ["Jan ter Meulen 1, Marlis Badusche 2, Kristiane Kuhnt 1, Andrea Doetze 2, Judith Satoguina 2, Thomas Marti 2, Cornelius Loeliger 3, Kekoura Koulemou 4, Lamine Koivogui 4, Herbert Schmitz 1, Bernhard Fleischer 2, Achim Hoerauf 2"], "related_topics": ["Lassa fever", "Lassa virus", "Viral hemorrhagic fever", "Virus", "Cellular immunity", "RNA virus", "Human morbidity", "Fulminant", "Virology", "Biology"], "citation_count": "112", "reference_count": "33", "references": ["2069340283", "2150492554", "2041218370", "2155025120", "1760886018", "1483035379", "1993027018", "2138694080", "2116525981", "2144304716"]}, {"id": "2036182565", "title": "Preexisting influenza-specific CD4+ T cells correlate with disease protection against influenza challenge in humans", "abstract": "Protective immunity against influenza virus infection is mediated by neutralizing antibodies, but the precise role of T cells in human influenza immunity is uncertain.

One type of element is an adenylate- and uridylate-rich element (ARE) found in the 3' untranslated region of many highly unstable mRNAs for mammalian early-response genes (ERGs). Among the better-characterized members of the ERG family are certain genes encoding nuclear transcription factors. Of particular significance was the finding that their mRNAs decay rapidly with kinetics similar to those of c-fos mRNA. Our previous studies of the c-fos ARE-directed mRNA decay have revealed the existence in this ARE of two structurally distinct and functionally interdependent domains, termed domain I and domain II. We proposed that the c-fos ARE-directed decay is a two-step mechanism in which rapid shortening of the poly(A) tail leads to the decay of the mRNA body and further hypothesized that this is a general mechanism by which the ERG AREs mediate rapid mRNA degradation. To test this hypothesis and to further address the generality of the critical structural characteristics within the c-fos ARE, the RNA-destabilizing functions of more than 10 different AU-rich sequences from various nuclear transcription factor mRNAs have been tested. Consistent with the above-mentioned hypothesis is the observation that mRNAs carrying the functional AREs display a biphasic decay, which is characteristic of the proposed two-step mechanism. Our results indicated that the presence of AUUUA pentanucleotides in an AU-rich region does not always guarantee an RNA-destabilizing function for this region. Our results also led to the identification of a novel class of AU-rich destabilizing elements which contains no AUUUA pentanucleotide. The results of sequence comparison and functional tests revealed that a continuous U-rich sequence is a unique feature among the functional AREs. Finally, our experiments further showed that the c-fos ARE domain II has an RNA decay-enhancing ability upon its fusion to heterologous AU-rich regions and defined for the first time an RNA decay-enhancing element, which we termed the RDE element.", "date": "1994", "authors": ["Chyi-Ying A Chen , Ann-Bin Shyu"], "related_topics": ["AU-rich element", "P-bodies", "Untranslated region", "Regulatory sequence", "Messenger RNA", "RNA", "Transcription factor", "Gene", "Cell biology", "Genetics", "Biology"], "citation_count": "372", "reference_count": "39", "references": ["2080532845", "2021253208", "1976415203", "2051819610", "2107359522", "2057094603", "1971421846", "1993210315", "1760280961", "2082658854"]}, {"id": "2318770038", "title": "Quantitation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in the blood of infected persons.", "abstract": "We used end-point-dilution cultures to measure the level of infectious human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma of 54 infected patients who were not receiving antiviral chemotherapy.

Today, these metals are widely used in electronics, catalysis, and as structural materials, but when they are fashioned into structures with nanometer-sized dimensions, they also become enablers for a completely different set of applications that involve light. These new applications go far beyond merely reflecting light, and have renewed our interest in maneuvering the interactions between metals and light in a field known as plasmonics.2\u20136 In plasmonics, the metal nanostructures can serve as antennas to convert light into localized electric fields (E-fields) or as waveguides to route light to desired locations with nanometer precision. These applications are made possible through a strong interaction between incident light and free electrons in the nanostructures. With a tight control over the nanostructures in terms of size and shape, light can be effectively manipulated and controlled with unprecedented accuracy.3,7 While many new technologies stand to be realized from plasmonics, with notable examples including superlenses,8 invisible cloaks,9 and quantum computing,10,11 conventional technologies like microprocessors and photovoltaic devices could also be made significantly faster and more efficient with the integration of plasmonic nanostructures.12\u201315 Of the metals, Ag has probably played the most important role in the development of plasmonics, and its unique properties make it well-suited for most of the next-generation plasmonic technologies.16\u201318 1.1. What is Plasmonics? Plasmonics is related to the localization, guiding, and manipulation of electromagnetic waves beyond the diffraction limit and down to the nanometer length scale.4,6 The key component of plasmonics is a metal, because it supports surface plasmon polariton modes (indicated as surface plasmons or SPs throughout this review), which are electromagnetic waves coupled to the collective oscillations of free electrons in the metal. While there are a rich variety of plasmonic metal nanostructures, they can be differentiated based on the plasmonic modes they support: localized surface plasmons (LSPs) or propagating surface plasmons (PSPs).5,19 In LSPs, the time-varying electric field associated with the light (Eo) exerts a force on the gas of negatively charged electrons in the conduction band of the metal and drives them to oscillate collectively. At a certain excitation frequency (w), this oscillation will be in resonance with the incident light, resulting in a strong oscillation of the surface electrons, commonly known as a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) mode.20 This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 1A. Structures that support LSPRs experience a uniform Eo when excited by light as their dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength of the light. Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the two types of plasmonic nanostructures discussed in this article as excited by the electric field (Eo) of incident light with wavevector (k). In (A) the nanostructure is smaller than the wavelength of light and the free electrons ... In contrast, PSPs are supported by structures that have at least one dimension that approaches the excitation wavelength, as shown in Figure 1B.4 In this case, the Eo is not uniform across the structure and other effects must be considered. In such a structure, like a nanowire for example, SPs propagate back and forth between the ends of the structure. This can be described as a Fabry-Perot resonator with resonance condition l=n\u03bbsp, where l is the length of the nanowire, n is an integer, and \u03bbsp is the wavelength of the PSP mode.21,22 Reflection from the ends of the structure must also be considered, which can change the phase and resonant length. Propagation lengths can be in the tens of micrometers (for nanowires) and the PSP waves can be manipulated by controlling the geometrical parameters of the structure.23", "date": "2011", "authors": ["Matthew Rycenga , Claire M.

ABC proteins that confer drug resistance include (but are not limited to) P-glycoprotein (gene symbol ABCB1), the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1, gene symbol ABCC1), MRP2 (gene symbol ABCC2), and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, gene symbol ABCG2). In addition to their role in drug resistance, there is substantial evidence that these efflux pumps have overlapping functions in tissue defense. Collectively, these proteins are capable of transporting a vast and chemically diverse array of toxicants including bulky lipophilic cationic, anionic, and neutrally charged drugs and toxins as well as conjugated organic anions that encompass dietary and environmental carcinogens, pesticides, metals, metalloids, and lipid peroxidation products. P-glycoprotein, MRP1, MRP2, and BCRP/ABCG2 are expressed in tissues important for absorption (e.g., lung and gut) and metabolism and elimination (liver and kidney). In addition, these transporters have an important role in maintaining the barrier function of sanctuary site tissues (e.g., blood-brain barrier, blood-cerebral spinal fluid barrier, blood-testis barrier and the maternal-fetal barrier or placenta). Thus, these ABC transporters are increasingly recognized for their ability to modulate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of xenobiotics. In this review, the role of these four ABC transporter proteins in protecting tissues from a variety of toxicants is discussed. Species variations in substrate specificity and tissue distribution of these transporters are also addressed since these properties have implications for in vivo models of toxicity used for drug discovery and development.", "date": "2005", "authors": ["Elaine M.

The proposed MBASIC system is an image coding method that utilizes a 3-D model of the object which is to be reproduced. An input image is first analyzed and an output image using the 3-D model is then synthesized. A very low bit rate image transmission can be realized because the encoder sends only the required analysis parameters. Output images can be reconstructed without the noise corruption that reduces naturalness because the decoder synthesizes images from a similar 3-D model. In order to construct a 3-D model of a person's face, a method is developed which uses a 3-D wire frame face model. A full-face image is then projected onto this wire frame model.

Despite their importance, relatively little is known about the magnitude and duration of virus-specific CD4 T-cell responses. In particular, it is not known whether both CD4 Th1 memory and CD4 Th2 memory can be induced by viral infections. To address these issues, we quantitated virus-specific CD4 Th1 (interleukin 2 [IL-2] and gamma-interferon) and Th2 (IL-4) responses in mice acutely infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Using two sensitive assays (enzyme-linked immunospot assay and intracellular stain) to measure cytokine production at the single-cell level, we found that both CD4 Th1 and Th2 responses were induced during primary LCMV infection. At the peak (day 8) of the response, the frequency of LCMV-specific CD4 Th1 cells was 1/35 to 1/160 CD4 T cells, and the frequency of Th2 cells was 1/400. After viral clearance, the numbers of virus-specific CD4 T cells dropped to 1/260 to 1/3,700 and then were maintained at this level indefinitely. Upon rechallenge with LCMV, both CD4 Th1 and Th2 memory cells made an anamnestic response in vivo.

Adult females had more frequent illnesses than adult males; illnesses were less common in working women than in women not working outside the home.

Influenza infection rates, determined serologically, suggested relative sparing of young children from infection with type A (H1N1) and type B.

In 1996, the first major WNF epidemic in Europe occurred in Romania, with a high rate of neurological infections. We investigated the epidemic to characterise transmission patterns in this novel setting and to determine its origin. Methods Hospital-based surveillance identified patients admitted with acute aseptic meningitis and encephalitis in 40 Romanian districts, including Bucharest. Infection was confirmed with IgM capture and indirect IgG ELISAs. In October, 1996, we surveyed outpatients in Bucharest and seven other districts to estimate seroprevalence and to detect infected patients not admitted to hospital. We also measured the rates of infection and seropositivity in mosquitoes and birds, respectively. Results Between July 15 and Oct 12, we identified 393 patients with serologically confirmed or probable WNF infection, of whom 352 had acute central-nervous-system infections. 17 patients older than 50 years died. Fatality/case ratio and disease incidence increased with age. The outbreak was confined to 14 districts in the lower Danube valley and Bucharest (attack rate 12\u00b74/100\u2008000 people) with a seroprevalence of 4\u00b71%. The number of mild cases could not be estimated. WN virus was recovered from Culex pipiens mosquitoes, the most likely vector, and antibodies to WN virus were found in 41% of domestic fowl.

Our aim was, therefore, to ascertain whether hospital mortality is reduced in critically ill patients when they are managed with a PAC. Methods We did a randomised controlled trial to which we enrolled 1041 patients from 65 UK intensive care units. We assigned individuals to management with (n=519) or without (n=522) a PAC. The timing of insertion and subsequent clinical management were at the discretion of the treating clinician. Intensive care units decided a priori to have the option of using an alternative cardiac output-monitoring device in control patients. Findings 1014 patients were eligible for analysis. We noted no difference in hospital mortality between patients managed with or without a PAC (68% [346 of 506] vs 66% [333 of 507], p=0\u00b739; adjusted hazard ratio 1\u00b709, 95% CI 0\u00b794\u20131\u00b727). We noted complications associated with insertion of a PAC in 46 of 486 individuals in whom the device was placed, none of which was fatal.

Genome sequencing in viral outbreaks is desirable to characterize the infectious agent and determine its evolutionary rate. Genome sequencing also allows the identification of signatures of host adaptation, identification and monitoring of diagnostic targets, and characterization of responses to vaccines and treatments. The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome substitution rate in the Makona strain has been estimated at between 0.87\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-3) and 1.42\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-3) mutations per site per year. This is equivalent to 16-27 mutations in each genome, meaning that sequences diverge rapidly enough to identify distinct sub-lineages during a prolonged epidemic. Genome sequencing provides a high-resolution view of pathogen evolution and is increasingly sought after for outbreak surveillance. Sequence data may be used to guide control measures, but only if the results are generated quickly enough to inform interventions. Genomic surveillance during the epidemic has been sporadic owing to a lack of local sequencing capacity coupled with practical difficulties transporting samples to remote sequencing facilities. To address this problem, here we devise a genomic surveillance system that utilizes a novel nanopore DNA sequencing instrument. In April 2015 this system was transported in standard airline luggage to Guinea and used for real-time genomic surveillance of the ongoing epidemic. We present sequence data and analysis of 142 EBOV samples collected during the period March to October 2015. We were able to generate results less than 24 h after receiving an Ebola-positive sample, with the sequencing process taking as little as 15-60 min.

While various methods exist for evaluating the likelihood of paternity of each nonexcluded male, interpreting these likelihoods has hitherto been difficult, and no method takes account of the incomplete sampling and error-prone genetic data typical of large-scale studies of natural systems. We derive likelihood ratios for paternity inference with codominant markers taking account of typing error, and define a statistic delta for resolving paternity. Using allele frequencies from the study population in question, a simulation program generates criteria for delta that permit assignment of paternity to the most likely male with a known level of statistical confidence.

We sought evidence of HMPV infection in patients who had visited general practitioners, had influenzalike illnesses (ILI), and had negative tests for influenza and Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). As part of national virologic surveillance, sentinel general practices in England and Wales collected samples from patients of all ages with ILI during winter 2000\u201301. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HMPV, influenza A (H1 and H3), influenza B, and HRSV (A and B) was used to screen combined nose and throat swabs. PCR products from the HMPVpositive samples were sequenced to confirm identity and construct phylogenetic trees. Of 711 swabs submitted, 408 (57.3%) were negative for influenza and HRSV; HMPV was identified in 9 (2.2%) patients. HMPV appears to be associated with community-acquired ARTI. The extent of illness and possible complications related to this new human virus need to be clarified. espite control of many infectious diseases in the industrialized world, acute viral respiratory tract infections (ARTI) remain a leading cause of illness. Although usually self-limiting in healthy adults, these infections are responsible for a substantial loss of productive time and are important factors in the illness and death of the elderly population. Various genetically diverse viruses, often with multiple types, may cause respiratory illness; of these, influenza receives the greatest attention (1). Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is also increasingly implicated as an important pathogen (2). The association between the incidence of ARTI and excess winter deaths in the United Kingdom is well recognized (1). Regression modeling associates excess winter deaths with influenza and HRSV but also suggests that other pathogens may be involved (3). Studies of the impact of respiratory virus infections are limited by difficulty in distinguishing respiratory pathogens clinically and in the laboratory (4,5). Despite improved sensitivity with diagnostic techniques such as reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), approximately 40% of specimens from patients with community-acquired respiratory illnesses during peak winter months contain no identified viral pathogen (2,5,6). A new pneumovirus, Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), has recently been isolated in the Netherlands (7). The Pneumovirinae subfamily is classified into Pneumovirus, containing HRSV, and Metapneumovirus genera. In 2001, Van den Hoogen et al. (7) reported the detection of HMPV in nasopharyngeal aspirates taken in a 10-year period from 28 hospitalized children and infants with respiratory tract infections who had signs and symptoms similar to those of HRSV infection. Establishing sensitive methods for virus detection helps to clarify the relative contribution of different pathogens to the extent of illness in the community. This information is important for future development of specific antiviral therapies and vaccines.

The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone.

For the prophylaxis study, oral oseltamivir (100 mg once daily [n=12], 100 mg twice daily [n=12], or matching placebo [n=13], starting 26 hours before virus inoculation) was administered. For the treatment study, the same drug was given (20 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg twice daily, 200 mg once daily, or matching placebo [n=16], in each group starting 28 hours after inoculation). All regimens were continued for 5 days.Main Outcome MeasuresComparing placebo groups with pooled treatment groups, for prophylaxis, outcomes included frequency of infection and viral shedding; for treatment, viral shedding in titers.ResultsIn the prophylaxis study, 8 (67%) of 12 placebo and 8 (38%) of 21 oseltamivir recipients became infected (P=.16; efficacy, 61%); 6 (50%) placebo compared with 0 oseltamivir recipients shed virus (P<.001; efficacy, 100%), and 33% of placebo but no oseltamivir recipient had infection-related respiratory illness (P<.01). Among infected subjects in the treatment study (n=69), the viral titer area under the curve of the combined oseltamivir groups (n=56) was lower (median [interquartile range {IQR}], 80 [23-151] vs 273 [79-306] log10 tissue culture-infective doses50 per milliliter\u00d7hour; P=.02) than the placebo group (n=13), and the median (IQR) duration of viral shedding with therapy was reduced from 107 (83-131) to 58 (35-59) hours (P=.003). Oseltamivir treatment also reduced symptom scores (median [IQR] score-hours, 225 [97-349] vs 400 [189-645]; P=.05), and nasal proinflammatory cytokine levels.

We describe mathematical models for legged animal locomotion, focusing on rapidly running insects and highlighting past achievements and challenges that remain. Newtonian body--limb dynamics are most naturally formulated as piecewise-holonomic rigid body mechanical systems, whose constraints change as legs touch down or lift off. Central pattern generators and proprioceptive sensing require models of spiking neurons and simplified phase oscillator descriptions of ensembles of them. A full neuromechanical model of a running animal requires integration of these elements, along with proprioceptive feedback and models of goal-oriented sensing, planning, and learning.

For this purpose, a hydropathy scale has been composed wherein the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of each of the 20 amino acid side-chains is taken into consideration. The scale is based on an amalgam of experimental observations derived from the literature. The program uses a moving-segment approach that continuously determines the average hydropathy within a segment of predetermined length as it advances through the sequence. The consecutive scores are plotted from the amino to the carboxy terminus. At the same time, a midpoint line is printed that corresponds to the grand average of the hydropathy of the amino acid compositions found in most of the sequenced proteins. In the case of soluble, globular proteins there is a remarkable correspondence between the interior portions of their sequence and the regions appearing on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line, as well as the exterior portions and the regions on the hydrophilic side. The correlation was demonstrated by comparisons between the plotted values and known structures determined by crystallography. In the case of membrane-bound proteins, the portions of their sequences that are located within the lipid bilayer are also clearly delineated by large uninterrupted areas on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line. As such, the membrane-spanning segments of these proteins can be identified by this procedure.

The goal is to demonstrate that several problems previously associated with the approach can be attributed to the low dimensionality of invariants used. These include limited index selectivity. Excessive accumulation of votes in the look-up table buckets, and excessive sensitivity to quantization parameters. Theoretical results demonstrate that using high-dimensional, highly descriptive global invariants produces better results in terms of accuracy, false positive suppression, and computation time. A practical example of high-dimensional global invariants is introduced and used to implement a 2-D shape acquisition/recognition system. The acquisition/recognition system is based on a two-step table look-up mechanism. First, local curve descriptors are obtained by correlating image contour information at short range. Then, seven-dimensional global invariants are computed by correlating triplets of local curve descriptors at longer range. This experimental system is meant to illustrate the behavior of a high-dimensional indexing scheme. Indeed, its performance shows good agreement with the analytical model with respect to database size, fault tolerance, and recognition speed. Model acquisition time is linear to cubic in the number of object features. Object recognition time is constant to linear in the number of models in the database and linear to cubic in the number of features in the image. The system has been tested extensively. With more than 250 arbitrary shapes in the database. Unsupervised shape and subpart acquisition is demonstrated. >", "date": "1994", "authors": ["A. Califano , R.

One primary cause of productivity loss and plant mortality during drought is hydraulic failure(2-4). Drought stress creates trapped gas emboli in the water transport system, which reduces the ability of plants to supply water to leaves for photosynthetic gas exchange and can ultimately result in desiccation and mortality. At present we lack a clear picture of how thresholds to hydraulic failure vary across a broad range of species and environments, despite many individual experiments. Here we draw together published and unpublished data on the vulnerability of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for a large number of woody species, with a view to examining the likely consequences of climate change for forest biomes. We show that 70% of 226 forest species from 81 sites worldwide operate with narrow (<1 megapascal) hydraulic safety margins against injurious levels of drought stress and therefore potentially face long-term reductions in productivity and survival if temperature and aridity increase as predicted for many regions across the globe(5,6). Safety margins are largely independent of mean annual precipitation, showing that there is global convergence in the vulnerability of forests to drought, with all forest biomes equally vulnerable to hydraulic failure regardless of their current rainfall environment. These findings provide insight into why drought-induced forest decline is occurring not only in arid regions but also in wet forests not normally considered at drought risk(7,8).", "date": "2012", "authors": ["Brendan Choat 1, Steven Jansen 2, Tim J.

Methods We performed a multicenter study of 829 previously diagnosed fibromyalgia patients and controls using physician physical and interview examinations, including a widespread pain index (WPI), a measure of the number of painful body regions. Random forest and recursive partitioning analyses were used to guide the development of a case definition of fibromyalgia, to develop criteria, and to construct a symptom severity (SS) scale. Results Approximately 25% of fibromyalgia patients did not satisfy the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria at the time of the study. The most important diagnostic variables were WPI and categorical scales for cognitive symptoms, unrefreshed sleep, fatigue, and number of somatic symptoms. The categorical scales were summed to create an SS scale. We combined the SS scale and the WPI to recommend a new case definition of fibromyalgia: (WPI > or =7 AND SS > or =5) OR (WPI 3-6 AND SS > or =9). Conclusion This simple clinical case definition of fibromyalgia correctly classifies 88.1% of cases classified by the ACR classification criteria, and does not require a physical or tender point examination. The SS scale enables assessment of fibromyalgia symptom severity in persons with current or previous fibromyalgia, and in those to whom the criteria have not been applied.

The amino acid compositions of the two enzymes, however, are distinctive, especially the half-cystine value of 15 residues for the phage enzyme and 3 for the bacterial enzyme. The purified phage enzyme contains an exonuclease activity which is physically inseparable from the polymerase activity but is suppressed or obscured by conditions favorable for replication. The polymerase requires a single stranded template, with a free 3'-hydroxyl terminus, which is replicated to an extent that approaches but never exceeds the DNA input. The product is a helical structure in which the newly synthesized strand is covalently linked from its 5'-terminus to the 3'-terminus of the template. Various features of the replication process and the product suggest a mechanism in which the 3'-terminus of the template first loops back upon itself and then serves as the priming end for replication of the remainder of the template.

Maximum entropy is a probability distribution estimation technique widely used for a variety of natural language tasks, such as language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, and text segmentation. The underlying principle of maximum entropy is that without external knowledge, one should prefer distributions that are uniform. Constraints on the distribution, derived from labeled training data, inform the technique where to be minimally non-uniform. The maximum entropy formulation has a unique solution which can be found by the improved iterative scaling algorithm. In this paper, maximum entropy is used for text classification by estimating the conditional distribution of the class variable given the document. In experiments on several text datasets we compare accuracy to naive Bayes and show that maximum entropy is sometimes significantly better, but also sometimes worse. Much future work remains, but the results indicate that maximum entropy is a promising technique for text classification.", "date": "1998", "authors": ["Kamal Nigam , John Lafferty , Andrew McCallum"], "related_topics": ["Principle of maximum entropy", "Maximum-entropy Markov model", "Naive Bayes classifier", "Text segmentation", "Probability distribution", "Conditional probability distribution", "Language model", "Class variable", "Pattern recognition", "Computer science", "Artificial intelligence"], "citation_count": "1,281", "reference_count": "20", "references": []}, {"id": "2167034998", "title": "Relations between the statistics of natural images and the response properties of cortical cells.", "abstract": "The relative efficiency of any particular image-coding scheme should be defined only in relation to the class of images that the code is likely to encounter. To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells.

This paper is limited to the problem of making phylogenetic inference from restriction site maps. Several methods for making such inference have already been used or proposed (Avise et al., 1979a, 1979b;NeiandLi, 1979; Ferris et al., 1981), but all these methods depend upon the assumption that shared restriction sites reflect common evolutionary origins and are not the result of convergent evolution. Unfortunately, convergent evolution occurs with high probability for this type of data (Templeton, 1983). In addition, data from several different restriction enzymes are generally pooled in these analyses. Recently, Adams and Rothman (1982) have examined the distributions of cleavage sites and related sequences for 54 restriction endonucleases. They concluded 1) that cleavage sites and related sequences are distributed non-randomly in most DNA sequences, 2) that there is considerable heterogeneity between different restriction enzymes (even those with recognition sequences of the same length) with respect to the number and distribution of their respective cleavage sites and related sequences, and 3) that inference of phylogenetic relationship based on distances will be biased. In addition, Brown et al. (1982) sequenced 896 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA from humans and apes and concluded that about 90% of the substitutions were transitions. The predominance of transitions over transversions increases the probability of convergence over that expected when all base substitutions are assumed to be equally likely (Templeton, 1983). Therefore, a need exists for an algorithm of phylogenetic inference that deals more directly with the problem of convergent evolution and statistical inhomogeneity between different restriction enzymes. In this paper, I propose such an algorithm. After discussing the problem of estimation of a phylogenetic tree, the task of statistical testing is then addressed. First, I present a non-parametric statistical framework for testing the fit of one hypothesized phylogeny versus an alternative phylogeny. Second, non-parametric statistical procedures are presented for testing hypotheses about relative rates of evolution among the various lineages.", "date": "1983", "authors": ["Alan R.

Four field seasons after a one-time addition of seed, many added species were still present and reproducing, with plots seeded at the highest rate having species richness that was 83% greater and total plant cover that was 31% greater than controls. Total plant community cover increased significantly with the number of species added as seed, but total cover of pre-existing species was independent of the number of species added as seed, suggesting that the new species mainly filled previously ''empty'' sites. The proportion of added species that became established was negatively correlated with initial species richness of plots, suggesting that species-rich sites were more resistant to invasion. Plot invasibility also depended on the abundances and species richness of plant functional groups in the plots, but was independent of seed size and of total plant cover. The major functional groups of plants differed in their abilities to invade as seed, with perennial grasses being the poorest invaders and herbaceous legumes being the best. Thus, local biotic interactions and recruitment dynamics jointly determined diversity, species composition, and species abundances in these native grassland communities.

Env- and Gag-specific IL-21+ Tfh of LVL but not HVL macaques negatively correlated with viral load, suggesting better provision of T cell help to fCD8 cells. Tfreg positively correlated with fCD8 cells in LVL animals and negatively correlated with viremia, suggesting a potential benefit of Tfreg via suppression of chronic inflammation. In contrast, in HVL macaques, Tfreg and fCD8 cell frequencies tended to be negatively correlated, and a positive correlation was seen between Tfreg number and viremia, suggesting possible dysfunction and suppression of an effective fCD8 cell immune response.

We aimed to test the efficacy of a replication-competent vaccine based on attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV), as a postexposure treatment for MARV haemorrhagic fever. Methods We used a rhesus macaque model of MARV haemorrhagic fever that produced 100% lethality. We administered rVSV vectors expressing the MARV Musoke strain glycoprotein to five macaques 20\u201330 min after a high-dose lethal injection of homologous MARV. Three animals were MARV-positive controls and received non-specific rVSV vectors. We tested for viraemia, undertook analyses for haematology and serum biochemistry, and measured humoral and cellular immune responses. Findings All five rhesus monkeys that were treated with the rVSV MARV vectors as a postexposure treatment survived a high-dose lethal challenge of MARV for at least 80 days. None of these five animals developed clinical symptoms consistent with MARV haemorrhagic fever. All the control animals developed fulminant disease and succumbed to the MARV challenge by day 12. MARV disease in the controls was indicated by: high titres of MARV (10 3 \u201310 5 plaque-forming units per mL); development of leucocytosis with concurrent neutrophilia at end-stage disease; and possible damage to the liver, kidney, and pancreas. Interpretation Postexposure protection against MARV in non-human primates provides a paradigm for the treatment of MARV haemorrhagic fever. Indeed, these data suggest that rVSV-based filoviral vaccines might not only have potential as preventive vaccines, but also could be equally useful for postexposure treatment of filoviral infections.", "date": "2006", "authors": ["Kathleen M Daddario-DiCaprio 1, 2, Thomas W Geisbert 1, 2, Ute Str\u00f6her 3, 4, Joan B Geisbert 2, Allen Grolla 4, Elizabeth A Fritz 2, Lisa Fernando 4, Elliott Kagan 1, Peter B Jahrling 5, Lisa E Hensley 2, Steven M Jones 3, 4, Heinz Feldmann 3, 4"], "related_topics": ["Marburg virus disease", "Vesicular stomatitis virus", "Mononegavirales", "Vector (molecular biology)", "Vesicular Stomatitis", "Recombinant virus", "Virus", "Hemorrhagic Fevers", "Virology", "Immunology", "Biology"], "citation_count": "207", "reference_count": "33", "references": []}, {"id": "2109364787", "title": "A new optimizer using particle swarm theory", "abstract": "The optimization of nonlinear functions using particle swarm methodology is described.

Recently, techniques for the purification and culture-expansion of these human marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have been developed. The goals of the current study were to establish a reproducible system for the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs, and to characterize the effect of changes in the microenvironment upon the process. MSCs derived from 2nd or 3rd passage were cultured for 16 days in various base media containing 1 to 1000 nM dexamethasone (Dex), 0.01 to 4 mM L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (AsAP) or 0.25 mM ascorbic acid, and 1 to 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate (beta GP). Optimal osteogenic differentiation, as determined by osteoblastic morphology, expression of alkaline phosphatase (APase), reactivity with anti-osteogenic cell surface monoclonal antibodies, modulation of osteocalcin mRNA production, and the formation of a mineralized extracellular matrix containing hydroxyapatite was achieved with DMEM base medium plus 100 nM Dex, 0.05 mM AsAP, and 10 mM beta GP. The formation of a continuously interconnected network of APase-positive cells and mineralized matrix supports the characterization of this progenitor population as homogeneous. While higher initial seeding densities did not affect cell number of APase activity, significantly more mineral was deposited in these cultures, suggesting that events which occur early in the differentiation process are linked to end-stage phenotypic expression. Furthermore, cultures allowed to concentrate their soluble products in the media produced more mineralized matrix, thereby implying a role for autocrine or paracrine factors synthesized by human MSCs undergoing osteoblastic lineage progression. This culture system is responsive to subtle manipulations including the basal nutrient medium, dose of physiologic supplements, cell seeding density, and volume of tissue culture medium. Cultured human MSCs provide a useful model for evaluating the multiple factors responsible for the step-wise progression of cells from undifferentiated precursors to secretory osteoblasts, and eventually terminally differentiated osteocytes.", "date": "1997", "authors": ["Neelam Jaiswal 1, Stephen E.

As a first step to establishing the phenotypic characteristics of MPCs, we reported on the identification of unique cell surface proteins which were detected with monoclonal antibodies. In this study, the phenotypic characterization of human marrow-derived MPCs is further established through the identification of a cytokine expression profile under standardized growth medium conditions and in the presence of regulators of the osteogenic and stromal cell lineages, dexamethasone and interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), respectively. Constitutively expressed cytokines in this growth phase include G-CSF, SCF, LIF, M-CSF, IL-6, and IL-11, while GM-CSF, IL-3, TGF-beta 2 and OSM were not detected in the growth medium. Exposure of cells in growth medium to dexamethasone resulted in a decrease in the expression of LIF, IL-6, and IL-11. These cytokines have been reported to exert influence on the differentiation of cells derived from the bone marrow stroma through target cell receptors that utilize gp130-associated signal transduction pathways. Dexamethasone had no effect on the other cytokines expressed under growth medium conditions and was not observed to increase the expression of any of the cytokines measured in this study. In contrast, IL-1 alpha increased the expression of G-CSF, M-CSF, LIF, IL-6 and IL-11 and induced the expression of GM-CSF. IL-1 alpha had no effect on SCF expression and was not observed to decrease the production of any of the cytokines assayed. These data indicate that MPCs exhibit a distinct cytokine expression profile. We interpret this cytokine profile to suggest that MPCs serve specific supportive functions in the microenvironment of bone marrow. MPCs provide inductive and regulatory information which are consistent with the ability to support hematopoiesis, and also supply autocrine, paracrine, and juxtacrine factors that influence the cells of the marrow microenvironment itself. In addition, the cytokine profiles expressed by MPCs, in response to dexamethasone and IL-1 alpha, identify specific cytokines whose levels of expression change as MPCs differentiate or modulate their phenotype during osteogenic or stromagenic lineage entrance/progression.", "date": "1996", "authors": ["Stephen E.

Here, we quantify regional-scale vegetation die-off across southwestern North American woodlands in 2002-2003 in response to drought and associated bark beetle infestations. At an intensively studied site within the region, we quantified that after 15 months of depleted soil water content, >90% of the dominant, overstory tree species (Pinus edulis, a pinon) died. The die-off was reflected in changes in a remotely sensed index of vegetation greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), not only at the intensively studied site but also across the region, extending over 12,000 km2 or more; aerial and field surveys confirmed the general extent of the die-off. Notably, the recent drought was warmer than the previous subcontinental drought of the 1950s. The limited, available observations suggest that die-off from the recent drought was more extensive than that from the previous drought, extending into wetter sites within the tree species' distribution.

Several nonrandomized studies have suggested that interferon-alpha (IFN) may prolong survival in CML. In a randomized multicenter study the influence of IFN versus busulfan or hydroxyurea (HU) on survival of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) CML was examined. A total of 513 Ph+ patients were randomized for treatment as follows: 133 for IFN, 186 for busulfan, and 194 for HU. IFN-treated CML patients have a significant survival advantage over busulfan-treated (P = .008), but not over HU-treated patients (P = .44). The longer survival is due to slower progression to blast crisis. Median survival of IFN-treated patients is 5.5 years [5-year survival, 59%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 48%-70%], of busulfan-treated patients, 3.8 years (5-year survival, 32%; CI, 24%-40%), and of HU-treated patients, 4.7 years (5-year survival, 44%; CI, 36%-53%). Patients who continue on IFN survive longer than those in whom IFN is discontinued before blast crisis (P = .007). Complete hematologic IFN-responders have a survival advantage over partial responders or nonresponders (P = .02). Cytogenetic IFN-responders have no significant survival advantage over nonresponders (P = .2). Patients who attain white blood cell (WBC) counts of 10 x 10(9)/L or less have a survival advantage in the IFN (P = .007) and HU (P = .05) groups. Whereas toxicity in the IFN group was considerably higher than in the busulfan or HU groups, long-lasting cytopenias necessitating discontinuation of therapy as observed with busulfan have not been seen with IFN or HU. The problems of conventional prognostic scores (Sokal's score, Score 1) that we observed in IFN-treated patients support the idea that IFN changes the natural course of CML. We conclude that, with regard to survival of CML in the chronic phase, IFN is superior to busulfan and as effective as HU. Whether and to what extent IFN is superior to HU appears to depend, at least in part, on the degree of WBC suppression by HU-therapy and on the risk profile of the patients.", "date": "1994", "authors": ["R Hehlmann , H Heimpel , J Hasford , HJ Kolb , H Pralle , DK Hossfeld , W Queisser , H Loffler , A Hochhaus , B Heinze"], "related_topics": ["Busulfan", "Chronic myelogenous leukemia", "Interferon alfa", "Chemotherapy", "Alpha interferon", "White blood cell", "Pharmacotherapy", "Discontinuation", "Gastroenterology", "Immunology", "Medicine", "Internal medicine"], "citation_count": "616", "reference_count": "44", "references": []}, {"id": "2718090702", "title": "Host Factors in Coronavirus Replication.", "abstract": "Coronaviruses are pathogens with a serious impact on human and animal health.

Despite the economic and societal impact of such coronavirus infections, and the likelihood of future outbreaks of additional pathogenic coronaviruses, our options to prevent or treat coronavirus infections remain very limited. This highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of these viruses and their interactions with the host. Compared to other +RNA viruses, coronaviruses have an exceptionally large genome and employ a complex genome expression strategy. Next to a role in basic virus replication or virus assembly, many of the coronavirus proteins expressed in the infected cell contribute to the coronavirus-host interplay. For example, by interacting with the host cell to create an optimal environment for coronavirus replication, by altering host gene expression or by counteracting the host\u2019s antiviral defenses. These coronavirus\u2013host interactions are key to viral pathogenesis and will ultimately determine the outcome of infection. Due to the complexity of the coronavirus proteome and replication cycle, our knowledge of host factors involved in coronavirus replication is still in an early stage compared to what is known for some other +RNA viruses.

We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. However these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class.

We introduce the concept of multiplicative neural networks that contain units that multiply their inputs instead of summing them and thus allow inputs to interact nonlinearly. The class of multiplicative neural networks comprises such widely known and well-studied network types as higher-order networks and product unit networks.We investigate the complexity of computing and learning for multiplicative neural networks. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension and the pseudodimension for various types of networks with multiplicative units. As the most general case, we consider feedforward networks consisting of product and sigmoidal units, showing that their pseudo-dimension is bounded from above by a polynomial with the same order of magnitude as the currently best-known bound for purely sigmoidal networks. Moreover, we show that this bound holds even when the unit type, product or sigmoidal, may be learned. Crucial for these results are calculations of solution set components bounds for new network classes. As to lower bounds, we construct product unit networks of fixed depth with superlinear VC dimension.For sigmoidal networks of higher order, we establish polynomial bounds that, in contrast to previous results, do not involve any restriction of the network order. We further consider various classes of higher-order units, also known as sigma-pi units, that are characterized by connectivity constraints. In terms of these, we derive some asymptotically tight bounds.Multiplication plays an important role in both neural modeling of biological behavior and computing and learning with artificial neural networks.

To do this, eHealth researchers must combine best evidence from the user sciences (human factors engineering, human-computer interaction, psychology, and usability) with best evidence in medicine to create transformational improvements in the quality of care that medicine offers. These improvements should follow recommendations from the Institute of Medicine to create a health care system that is (a) safe, (b) effective (evidence-based), (c) patient-centered, and (d) timely. Relying on the eHealth researcher\u2019s intuitive grasp of systems issues, improvements should be made with considerations of users and beneficiaries at the individual (patient/physician), group (family/staff), community, and broad environmental levels.", "date": "2007", "authors": ["Bradford W.

TNF-positive serum is as effective as endotoxin itself in causing necrosis of the sarcoma Meth A and other transplanted tumors. A variety of tests indicate that TNF is not residual endotoxin, but a factor released from host cells, probably macrophages, by endotoxin.

We review these algorithms and describe a large empirical study comparing several variants in conjunction with a decision tree inducer (three variants) and a Naive-Bayes inducer. The purpose of the study is to improve our understanding of why and when these algorithms, which use perturbation, reweighting, and combination techniques, affect classification error. We provide a bias and variance decomposition of the error to show how different methods and variants influence these two terms. This allowed us to determine that Bagging reduced variance of unstable methods, while boosting methods (AdaBoost and Arc-x4) reduced both the bias and variance of unstable methods but increased the variance for Naive-Bayes, which was very stable. We observed that Arc-x4 behaves differently than AdaBoost if reweighting is used instead of resampling, indicating a fundamental difference. Voting variants, some of which are introduced in this paper, include: pruning versus no pruning, use of probabilistic estimates, weight perturbations (Wagging), and backfitting of data. We found that Bagging improves when probabilistic estimates in conjunction with no-pruning are used, as well as when the data was backfit. We measure tree sizes and show an interesting positive correlation between the increase in the average tree size in AdaBoost trials and its success in reducing the error. We compare the mean-squared error of voting methods to non-voting methods and show that the voting methods lead to large and significant reductions in the mean-squared errors.

For this hope to be fulfilled, the phylogenetic position of the model organism within a larger evolutionary framework must be known. We focus here on major model organisms of developmental genetics and cell biology. We first consider the positions of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the arthropod Drosophila melanogaster within a phylogeny of the major advanced metazoan groups. Then we consider the evolutionary relationships between fungi (represented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe ), plants, and animals. Results We show, by a direct comparison with small subunit ribosomal RNA (185 rRNA), that RNA polymerase II is an appropriate molecule for addressing the phylogenetic branchings in the early evolution of eukaryotes. The results from the analyses of newly determined and previously published sequences of the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II suggest the following. Firstly, that plants and animals share a last common ancestor that excludes fungi, the lineage of which originated earlier. Secondly, that the lineage leading to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans diverged earlier from the Metazoa than the lineages of arthropods, deuterostomes, annelids and molluscs. Finally, that deuterostomes arose from within protostomes. Conclusions RNA polymerase II is well-suited for the elucidation of the evolutionary relationships among eukaryotes.

Here we show that phage-to-bacteria ratios were increased, relative to the adjacent environment, on all mucosal surfaces sampled, ranging from cnidarians to humans. In vitro studies of tissue culture cells with and without surface mucus demonstrated that this increase in phage abundance is mucus dependent and protects the underlying epithelium from bacterial infection. Enrichment of phage in mucus occurs via binding interactions between mucin glycoproteins and Ig-like protein domains exposed on phage capsids. In particular, phage Ig-like domains bind variable glycan residues that coat the mucin glycoprotein component of mucus. Metagenomic analysis found these Ig-like proteins present in the phages sampled from many environments, particularly from locations adjacent to mucosal surfaces. Based on these observations, we present the bacteriophage adherence to mucus model that provides a ubiquitous, but non\u2013host-derived, immunity applicable to mucosal surfaces. The model suggests that metazoan mucosal surfaces and phage coevolve to maintain phage adherence.

Although some antibiotics are used both in animals and humans, most of the resistance problem in humans has arisen from human use. Resistance can be selected in food animals, and resistant bacteria can contaminate animal-derived food, but adequate cooking destroys them. How often they colonize the human gut, and transfer resistance genes is not known. In zoonotic salmonellosis, resistance may arise in animals or humans, but human cross-infection is common. The case of campylobacter infection is less clear. The normal human faecal flora can contain resistant enterococci, but indistinguishable strains in animals and man are uncommon, possibly because most animal enterococci do not establish themselves in the human intestine. There is no correlation between the carriage of resistant enterococci of possible animal origin and human infection with resistant strains. Commensal Escherichia coli also exhibits host-animal preferences. Anti-Gram-positive growth promoters would be expected to have little effect on most Gram-negative organisms.

Since then, developments in logic, statis- tics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement record- ing systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The stor- age and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components - not at the level of holistic perceptual expe- riences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a com- mon frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspec- tion (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and ab- stract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinato- rially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a per- ceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal sym- bol systems.

Most previous pitch-estimation methods have had difficulty dealing with such complex music signals because these methods were designed to deal with mixtures of only a few sounds. To enable estimation of the fundamental frequency (F0) of the melody and bass lines, we propose a predominant-F0 estimation method called PreFEst that does not rely on the unreliable fundamental component and obtains the most predominant F0 supported by harmonics within an intentionally limited frequency range. This method estimates the relative dominance of every possible F0 (represented as a probability density function of the F0) by using MAP (maximum a posteriori probability) estimation and considers the F0\u2019s temporal continuity by using a multiple-agent architecture.

The specificity of such binding is indicated by its inhibition in either productively or nonproductively infected cell lines. In general, gp70 binding parallels host range although notable exceptions are seen. For instance, while MPMV exhibits a much narrower host range than SMRV, envelope glycoproteins isolated from the two viruses exhibit similar binding characteristics. Thus, the resistance to MPMV infection of most mammalian cell lines tested apparently involves replication steps subsequent to receptor binding. Interference studies reveal that gp70s of type-C viruses of the highly related M7/RD114 primate group and representative type-D retroviruses, such as MPMV and SMRV, recognize the same or similar cellular receptors. Such receptors are strikingly different from these recognized by a murine amphotropic type-C virus isolate, 4070-A.

From the DNA sequence we conclude that the organization of the B19 transcription units is similar although not identical to those of other parvoviruses. In particular, we predict that the B19 genome may utilize a fourth promoter to transcribe mRNA encoding the major structural polypeptide, VP2. Analysis of the putative polypeptides confirms that B19 is only distantly related to the other parvoviruses but reveals that there is a small region in the gene probably encoding the major nonstructural protein of B19, which is closely conserved between all of the parvovirus genomes for which sequence information is currently available.", "date": "1986", "authors": ["R O Shade , M C Blundell , S F Cotmore , P Tattersall , C R Astell"], "related_topics": ["Nucleic acid sequence", "Genomic organization", "Gene", "Genome", "DNA sequencing", "Parvovirus", "Coding region", "Peptide sequence", "Genetics", "Biology"], "citation_count": "585", "reference_count": "48", "references": ["2144634347", "2138270253", "1975304761", "1992595091", "1984917385", "2022277835", "2088084795", "2028973331", "2078199950", "2020033150"]}, {"id": "2153653739", "title": "Statistical phrase-based translation", "abstract": "We propose a new phrase-based translation model and decoding algorithm that enables us to evaluate and compare several, previously proposed phrase-based translation models.

UWB transmission technology is particularly attractive for short- to medium-range localization, especially in GPS-denied environments: wide transmission bandwidths enable robust communication in dense multipath scenarios, and the ability to resolve subnanosecond delays results in centimeter-level distance resolution. We will describe several cooperative localization algorithms and quantify their performance, based on realistic UWB ranging models developed through an extensive measurement campaign using FCC-compliant UWB radios. We will also present a powerful localization algorithm by mapping a graphical model for statistical inference onto the network topology, which results in a net-factor graph, and by developing a suitable net-message passing schedule.

In the studies described in this report, virus-associated antigens in T-cell clones permanently producing HTLV-III were subjected to biochemical and immunological analyses. Antigens of HTLV-III, specifically detected by antibodies in serum from AIDS or pre-AIDS patients and revealed by the Western blot technique, are similar in size to those found in other subgroups of HTLV.

Antiviral drugs are seen as essential requirements for control of initial influenza outbreaks caused by a new virus, and in pre-pandemic plans there is a heavy reliance on drug stockpiles. The principal target for these drugs is a virus surface glycoprotein, neuraminidase, which facilitates the release of nascent virus and thus the spread of infection. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are two currently used neuraminidase inhibitors that were developed using knowledge of the enzyme structure. It has been proposed that the closer such inhibitors resemble the natural substrate, the less likely they are to select drug-resistant mutant viruses that retain viability. However, there have been reports of drug-resistant mutant selection in vitro and from infected humans. We report here the enzymatic properties and crystal structures of neuraminidase mutants from H5N1-infected patients that explain the molecular basis of resistance. Our results show that these mutants are resistant to oseltamivir but still strongly inhibited by zanamivir owing to an altered hydrophobic pocket in the active site of the enzyme required for oseltamivir binding. Together with recent reports of the viability and pathogenesis of H5N1 (ref. 7) and H1N1 (ref. 8) viruses with neuraminidases carrying these mutations, our results indicate that it would be prudent for pandemic stockpiles of oseltamivir to be augmented by additional antiviral drugs, including zanamivir.", "date": "2008", "authors": ["Patrick J.

We use the geometry of a Manduca sexta-based robotic wing to define the shape of a three-dimensional 'virtual' wing model and 'hover' this wing, mimicking accurately the three-dimensional movements of the wing of a hovering hawkmoth. Our CFD analysis has established an overall understanding of the viscous and unsteady flow around the flapping wing and of the time course of instantaneous force production, which reveals that hovering flight is dominated by the unsteady aerodynamics of both the instantaneous dynamics and also the past history of the wing. A coherent leading-edge vortex with axial flow was detected during translational motions of both the up- and downstrokes. The attached leading-edge vortex causes a negative pressure region and, hence, is responsible for enhancing lift production. The axial flow, which is derived from the spanwise pressure gradient, stabilises the vortex and gives it a characteristic spiral conical shape. The leading-edge vortex created during previous translational motion remains attached during the rotational motions of pronation and supination. This vortex, however, is substantially deformed due to coupling between the translational and rotational motions, develops into a complex structure, and is eventually shed before the subsequent translational motion. Estimation of the forces during one complete flapping cycle shows that lift is produced mainly during the downstroke and the latter half of the upstroke, with little force generated during pronation and supination. The stroke plane angle that satisfies the horizontal force balance of hovering is 23.6 degrees , which shows excellent agreement with observed angles of approximately 20-25 degrees .

Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees.

Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recordhag information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalization of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.The object of this paper is to throw light on the relationships between certain classes of econometric models involving feedback and the functions arising in spectral analysis, particularly the cross spectrum and the partial cross spectrum. Causality and feedback are here defined in an explicit and testable fashion. It is shown that in the two-variable case the feedback mechanism can be broken down into two causal relations and that the cross spectrum can be considered as the sum of two cross spectra, each closely connected with one of the causations.

Procedure\u2014Nasal swab specimens were obtained from cattle at arrival in a feedlot (day 0) and at various times during the initial 28 days after arrival. Specimens were tested for BCV, using an antigencapture ELISA. Serum samples were obtained at arrival and again 28 days after arrival and tested for antibodies to BCV, using an antibody-detection ELISA. Information was collected regarding treatment for cattle with respiratory tract disease and average daily gain during the feeding period. Pulmonary lesions were evaluated at slaughter. Results\u2014Cattle shedding BCV from the nasal cavity and developing an antibody response against BCV were 1.6 times more likely to require treatment for respiratory tract disease than cattle that did not shed the virus or develop an immune response against BCV. Additionally, cattle that shed BCV from the nasal cavity were 2.2 times more likely to have pulmonary lesions at slaughter than cattle that did not shed the virus. The BCV shedding or seroconversion status did not affect average daily gain.

This is an essentially nonlinear, nonparametric method for designing experiments which will directly determine a state space representation for an unknown black box. This method assumes (1) a finite dimensional state space is possible, (2) the unknown black box can be reset to its initial state at will, so that an arbitrary set of experiments can be performed, and (3) there is no plant noise, so that applying given inputs to the initial state will always yield the same state, so various experiments can be performed on it. In the initial, informal discussion the properties of this method of system identification are compared to the properties of the method of parameter estimation via loss function minimization, e.g. least square error or maximum likelihood, which is the only general approach to system identification presently available. Loss function minimization will utilize any data, but it is computationally difficult and essentially parametric. State characterization eliminates the computational requirement at the expense of requiring specific data, and it is essentially nonparametric. It is proposed that state characterization may have practical application in determining an approximate, low order description of a complex system about which we have little prior information, for instance in the social sciences and medicine. The formal presentation is limited to finite state automata and discrete time linear systems. The situation is considered in which the order of the unknown black box, the minimum size state space required to represent it, is not known a priori; so it is necessary to continue experimenting indefinitely, using the results to obtain successively better descriptions of the unknown black box. Detailed algorithms are presented for obtaining either a Moore model or a Mealy model description. Branching rules for using past data to choose subsequent experiments in order to hasten convergence are presented.

It undergoes a large conformational change between an open and a closed state, even in the absence of substrate. We investigate the apo-AdK transition at the atomic level both with free-energy calculations and with our new dynamic importance sampling (DIMS) molecular dynamics method. DIMS is shown to sample biologically relevant conformations as verified by comparing an ensemble of hundreds of DIMS transitions to AdK crystal structure intermediates. The simulations reveal in atomic detail how hinge regions partially and intermittently unfold during the transition. Conserved salt bridges are seen to have important structural and dynamic roles; in particular, four ionic bonds that open in a sequential, zipper-like fashion and, thus, dominate the free-energy landscape of the transition are identified. Transitions between the closed and open conformations only have to overcome moderate free-energy barriers. Unexpectedly, the closed state and the open state encompass broad free-energy basins that contain conformations differing in domain hinge motions by up to 40 degrees . The significance of these extended states is discussed in relation to recent experimental Forster resonance energy transfer measurements. Taken together, these results demonstrate how a small number of cooperative key interactions can shape the overall dynamics of an enzyme and suggest an \"all-or-nothing\" mechanism for the opening and closing of AdK.

We could show that virus was absorbed and de novo virus protein synthesis was initiated, but actual virus replication was extremely low; 24\u201336 h after infection, monocytes and macrophages died of apoptosis. Before cell death, an influenza A virus infection induced strong mRNA accumulation of cytokines: tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), interleukin-1 (IL1) and IL6. However, the translation into bioactive cytokine protein was rather low, and high cytokine production was only found when a secondary signal such as LPS was added. Influenza A virus infection of mononuclear phagocytes displayed a characteristic feature at the level of cytokine gene transcription which was not found with other viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus: in addition to the regular 1.7-kb TNF\u03b1 mRNA, a high molecular weight (hmw) TNF\u03b1 mRNA of 2.4 kb was detected.

To establish an EBOV transmission model for performing studies with statistical significance, groups of six guinea pigs (gps) were challenged intranasally (i.n.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10,000 times the 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) of gp-adapted EBOV, and naive gps were then introduced as cage mates for contact exposure at 1 day postinfection (p.i.). The animals were monitored for survival and clinical signs of disease and quantitated for virus shedding postexposure. Changes in the duration of contact of naive gps with infected animals were evaluated for their impact on transmission efficiency. Transmission was more efficient from i.n.- than from i.p.-challenged gps, with 17% versus 83% of naive gps surviving exposure, respectively. Virus shedding was detected beginning at 3 days p.i. from both i.n.- and i.p.-challenged animals. Contact duration positively correlated with transmission efficiency, and the abrogation of direct contact between infected and naive animals through the erection of a steel mesh was effective at stopping virus spread, provided that infectious animal bedding was absent from the cages. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings show that i.n.-infected gps display enhanced lung pathology and EBOV antigen in the trachea, which supports increased virus transmission from these animals. The results suggest that i.n.-challenged gps are more infectious to naive animals than their systemically infected counterparts and that transmission occurs through direct contact with infectious materials, including those transported through air movement over short distances. IMPORTANCE Ebola is generally thought to be spread between humans though infectious bodily fluids. However, a study has shown that Ebola can be spread from pigs to monkeys without direct contact. Further studies have been hampered, because an economical animal model for Ebola transmission is not available. To address this, we established a transmission model in guinea pigs and determined the mechanisms behind virus spread. The survival data, in addition to microscopic examination of lung and trachea sections, show that mucosal infection of guinea pigs is an efficient model for Ebola transmission. Virus spread is increased with longer contact times with an infected animal and is possible without direct contact between an infected and a naive host but can be stopped if infectious materials are absent. These results warrant consideration for the development of future strategies against Ebola transmission and for a better understanding of the parameters involved in virus spread.", "date": "2015", "authors": ["Gary Wong 1, 2, Xiangguo Qiu 2, Jason S.

Various animal models have been established to investigate HCoV infection, including mice and non-human primates. To establish a link between the research conducted in animal models and humans, an organotypic human airway culture system, that recapitulates the human airway epithelium, has been developed. Currently, different cell culture systems are available to recapitulate the human airways, including the Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) human airway epithelium (HAE) model. Tracheobronchial HAE cultures recapitulate the primary entry point of human respiratory viruses while the alveolar model allows for elucidation of mechanisms involved in viral infection and pathogenesis in the alveoli. These organotypic human airway cultures represent a universal platform to study respiratory virus-host interaction by offering more detailed insights compared to cell lines. Additionally, the epidemic potential of this virus family highlights the need for both vaccines and antivirals.

High rates of sexually transmitted diseases, rapidly increasing seroprevalence in female commercial sex workers, and inadequate facilities for HIV testing, counseling, and prevention are the major contributing factors in the recent explosive increases in the numbers of HIV infections (5, 6, 24, 29). While antiretroviral drugs have reduced mortality from AIDS in developed nations, their effect will be negligible elsewhere due to their cost. For most communicable diseases, vaccines offer the most cost-effective control strategy. It is likely that development of a vaccine for HIV will require knowledge of the viral variants being transmitted in the target population. Despite India\u2019s impending predominance in the worldwide pandemic, little is known of the genetic diversity of HIV-1 in India. The HIV-1 sequence database is growing exponentially, but the distribution of submitted sequences is not representative of the worldwide picture. Subtype C has been reported in nearly every region affected by HIV-1 (11, 23, 28) and predominates in India, and it also causes 74% of infections in southern Africa and 96% of infections in northern Africa (11, 18, 32). Given the combined population of India and the other regions affected, subtype C is likely to be the most commonly transmitted HIV-1 subtype worldwide. In contrast, 7% of the available HIV-1 sequence data is from subtype C-infected individuals (37), and of the 46 completely sequenced HIV-1 genomes (excluding multiple derivatives of HIV-1LAI), only two are of subtype C, one from a 1992 Brazilian sample and the other from a 1986 Ethiopian sample (37). In November 1997, an analysis of cross-clade epitope variation (9) excluded the C clade from evaluation of p24gag epitopes because of a lack of sequence data, whereas there was sufficient data to analyze subtypes A, B, D, F, G, and H (no HIV-1 harboring a subtype E gag gene has been found). Further sequence data from subtype C is needed, but the past approach of generating data from small subgenomic amplicons is no longer sufficient. Recent developments have made full-genome characterization of HIV-1 isolates both important and feasible. First, the recognition of intersubtype recombination in a significant proportion of HIV-1 sequences (44, 45) has led to detection of mosaic genomes in many regions of the world affected by multiple subtypes (14, 17, 31). Subtypes A, B, and C in India have been reported (4, 22, 30, 31, 59), but mosaic HIV-1 there has not been reported. The existence of such recombinants makes characterization of variants by analyzing subgenomic segments incomplete. Second, immune responses to vaccines based on single genes such as env have been limited (13), and attention is being shifted toward multivalent vaccines that incorporate other gene products. Third, interactions among discontinuous regions of the genome, such as between the long terminal repeat (LTR) and pol (26), can be detected only when such regions can be analyzed from the same template. In an effort to characterize subtype C virus genomes being transmitted currently in India, viral isolates were obtained from individuals with seroincident infections in India. Three of the isolates (collected in 1994 and 1995) were known to be non-syncytium inducing (NSI) and therefore resembled viruses transmitted through unprotected sexual contact, which account for 75 to 85% of new infections (2, 15, 61). These isolates were cloned, and nearly full-length genomic sequences were determined.

Given the success of this class of drugs in cancer treatment, it can be argued that microtubules represent the single best cancer target identified to date. Microtubules are highly dynamic assemblies of the protein tubulin. They readily polymerize and depolymerize in cells, and they undergo two interesting kinds of dynamics called dynamic instability and treadmilling. These dynamic behaviors are crucial to mitosis, the process of chromosomal division to form new cells. Microtubule dynamics are highly regulated during the cell cycle by endogenous cellular regulators. In addition, many antitumor drugs and natural compounds alter the polymerization dynamics of microtubules, blocking mitosis, and consequently, inducing cell death by apoptosis. These drugs include several that inhibit microtubule polymerization at high drug concentrations, namely, the Vinca alkaloids, cryptophycins, halichondrins, estramustine, and colchicine. Another group of these compounds stimulates microtubule polymerization and stabilizes microtubules at high concentrations. These include Taxol, Taxotere, eleutherobins, epothilones, laulimalide, sarcodictyins, and discodermolide. Importantly, considerable evidence indicates that, at lower concentrations, these drugs have a common mechanism of action; they suppress the dynamics of microtubules without appreciably changing the mass of microtubules in the cell. The drugs bind to diverse sites on tubulin and at different positions within the microtubule, and they have diverse effects on microtubule dynamics.

Uncertainty about the benefits of influenza vaccination for healthy senior citizens may contribute to lower rates of utilization in this group. Objective: To clarify the benefits of influenza vaccination among low-risk senior citizens while concurrently assessing the benefits for intermediate- and high-risk senior citizens. Methods: All elderly members of a large health maintenance organization were included in each of 6 consecutive study cohorts. Subjects were grouped according to risk status: high risk (having heart or lung disease), intermediate risk (having diabetes, renal disease, stroke and/or dementia, or rheumatologic disease), and low risk. Outcomes were compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects after controlling for baseline demographic and health characteristics. Results: There were more than 20 000 subjects in each of the 6 cohorts who provided 147 551 person-periods of observation. The pooled vaccination rate was 60%. There were 101 619 person-periods of observation for low-risk subjects, 15 482 for intermediate-risk, and 30 450 for highrisk subjects. Vaccination over the 6 seasons was associated with an overall reduction of 39% for pneumonia hospitalizations (P,.001), a 32% decrease in hospitalizations for all respiratory conditions (P,.001), and a 27% decrease in hospitalizations for congestive heart failure (P,.001). Immunization was also associated with a 50% reduction in all-cause mortality (P,.001). Within the risk subgroups, vaccine effectiveness was 29%, 32%, and 49% for high-, intermediate-, and low-risk senior citizens for reducing hospitalizations for pneumonia and influenza (for high and low risk, P#.002; for intermediate risk, P = .11). Effectiveness was 19%, 39%, and 33% (for each, P#.008), respectively, for reducing hospitalizations for all respiratory conditions and 49%, 64%, and 55% for reducing deaths from all causes (for each, P,.001). Vaccination was also associated with direct medical care cost savings of $73 per individual vaccinated for all subjects combined (P = .002). Estimates of cost savings within each risk group suggest that vaccination would be cost saving for each subgroup (range of cost savings of $171 per individual vaccinated for high risk to $7 for low risk), although within the subgroups these findings did not reach statistical significance (for each, P$.05). Conclusions: This study confirms that healthy senior citizens as well as senior citizens with underlying medical conditions are at risk for the serious complications of influenza and benefit from vaccination. All individuals 65 years or older should be immunized with this vaccine. Arch Intern Med. 1998;158:1769-1776", "date": "1998", "authors": ["Kristin L. Nichol , J.

Most nonhuman primate associated hepatitis outbreaks in man are caused by human hepatitis A virus, or an antigenically very similar or identical nonhuman primate hepatitis virus. The possible role of human hepatitis C (HC) viruses in these outbreaks cannot be evaluated because the agents have not yet been defined. Efforts to infect a large number of animal species, including the common laboratory varieties, various nonhuman primates, and somewhat more exotic species such as canaries, oysters, and mini-pigs, all met with negative results except for some sporadic and inconsistent positive findings in nonhuman primates, chiefly in chimpanzees. It was observed that nonhuman primates and particularly chimpanzees could transmit hepatitis to man and that \u201cspontaneous\u201d biochemically and histologically typical viral hepatitis occurred in recently caught chimpanzees. A major advance in hepatitis A research was the discovery of virus-like particles that could be agglutinated specifically by human convalescent sera in the early acute phase stools of human cases of hepatitis A (HA).

The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes).

Although person-to-person spread of current H5N1 strains is unlikely, the virus is a potential source of a future influenza pandemic. Our aim was to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine against the H5N1 strain. Methods We did a randomised, open-label, non-controlled phase I trial in 300 volunteers aged 18\u201340 years and assigned one of six inactivated split influenza A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) influenza vaccine formulations, comprising 7\u00b75 \u03bcg (with adjuvant n=50, without adjuvant n=49), 15 \u03bcg (n=50, n=50), or 30 \u03bcg (n=51, n=50) of haemagglutinin with or without aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. Individuals received two vaccinations (on days 0 and 21) and provided blood samples (on days 0, 21, and 42) for analysis by haemagglutination inhibition and microneutralisation. We recorded all adverse events. Analyses were descriptive. Findings All formulations were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events, few severe reactions, and no oral temperatures of more than 38\u00b0C. All formulations induced an immune response, and responses were detectable in some individuals after only one dose. The adjuvanted 30 \u03bcg formulation induced the greatest response (67% haemagglutinin-inhibition seroconversion rate after two vaccinations). Adjuvant did not improve the response to the lower doses. Two vaccinations of non-adjuvanted 7\u00b75 \u03bcg, adjuvanted 15 \u03bcg, or non-adjuvanted 15 \u03bcg seroconverted more than 40% of participants (haemagglutinin-inhibition test only). Haemagglutinin inhibition and neutralising results were comparable. Interpretation A two-dose regimen with an adjuvanted 30 \u03bcg inactivated H5N1 vaccine was safe and showed an immune response consistent with European regulatory requirements for licensure of seasonal influenza vaccine.

Hence it is important to study the dependence of image structure on the level of resolution. It seems clear enough that visual perception treats images on several levels of resolution simultaneously and that this fact must be important for the study of perception. However, no applicable mathematically formulated theory to deal with such problems appers to exist. In this paper it is shown that any image can be embedded in a one-parameter family of derived images (with resolution as the parameter) in essentially only one unique way if the constraint that no spurious detail should be generated when the resolution is diminished, is applied. The structure of this family is governed by the well known diffusion equation (a parabolic, linear, partial differential equation of the second order). As such the structure fits into existing theories that treat the front end of the visual system as a continuous tack of homogeneous layer, characterized by iterated local processing schemes. When resolution is decreased the images becomes less articulated because the extrem (\u201clight and dark blobs\u201d) disappear one after the other. This erosion of structure is a simple process that is similar in every case. As a result any image can be described as a juxtaposed and nested set of light and dark blobs, wherein each blod has a limited range of resolution in which it manifests itself. The structure of the family of derived images permits a derivation of the sampling density required to sample the image at multiple scales of resolution. The natural scale along the resolution axis (leading to an informationally uniform sampling density) is logarithmic, thus the structure is apt for the description of size invariances.", "date": "1983", "authors": ["Jan J.

Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. Methods An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, healthcare professionals and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. Results The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. Conclusion The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document.

CC-NOW machines provide the benefits of cache coherence to networks of workstations, at the cost of even higher remote access latency.

Using realistic workloads, we study the performance improvements provided by OS supported dynamic page migration and replication. Analyzing our kernel-based implementation, we provide a detailed breakdown of the costs.

The same lymphoid supernatants contained IFN gamma but not IFN alpha or IFN beta. The MAF activity of six of seven unfractionated supernatants was completely eliminated by a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IFN gamma, and MAF in the remaining supernatant was almost completely neutralized. Native IFN gamma partially purified by two independent protocols to specific activities of 1 X 10(6) and 10(7) U/mg protein was enriched in MAF activity at least as much as in antiviral activity. The capacity of macrophages to secrete H2O2 after incubation in partially purified native IFN gamma (mean peak stimulation, 8.8-fold) was greater than with unpurified lymphokines (3.8-fold) and sometimes equaled or exceeded the capacity of freshly harvested monocytes. The MAF activity of the partially purified native IFN gamma preparations was abolished by monoclonal anti-IFN gamma. Finally, IFN gamma of greater than 99% estimated purity was isolated (at Genentech, Inc.) from bacteria transformed with the cloned human gene for this lymphokine.

Attainment of 50% of the maximal elevation in peroxide-releasing capacity required a geometric mean concentration of 0.1 antiviral U/ml of recombinant IFN gamma, which is estimated to be approximately 6 picomolar for this preparation. Peroxide secretory capacity and toxoplasmacidal activity of macrophages peaked 2-4 d after exposure to IFN gamma. Peroxide-secretory capacity remained elevated during at least 6 d of continuous exposure, but the effect of IFN gamma was reversed within about 3 d of its removal.

Analogous proteins immunoprecipitated by SV40 T sera, ranging in molecular weight from 44K to 60K, were detected in human and monkey SV40-infected or -transformed cells. A wide variety of sera from hamsters and mice bearing SV40-induced tumors immunoprecipitated the 54K protein of SV40-transformed cells and murine embryonal carcinoma cells. Antibody produced by somatic cell hybrids between a B cell and a myeloma cell (hybridoma) against SV40 large T antigen also immunoprecipitated the 54K protein in virus-infected and -transformed cells, but did not do so in the embryonal carcinoma cell lines. We conclude that SV40 infection or transformation of mouse cells stimulates the synthesis or enhances the stability of a 54K protein. This protein appears to be associated with SV40 T antigen in SV40-infected and -transformed cells, and is co-immunoprecipitated by hybridoma sera to SV40 large T antigen. The 54K protein either shares antigenic determinants with SV40 T antigen or is itself immunogenic when in association with SV40 large T antigen. The protein varies with host cell species, and analogous proteins were observed in hamster, monkey and human cells. The role of this protein in transformation is unclear at present.", "date": "1979", "authors": ["Daniel I.H. Linzer , Arnold J.

Viruses were detected in 69% of aspirates, most commonly rhinoviruses (48.3%) and respiratory syncytial virus (10.9%). At 5 years, 28.3%(n = 56) had current wheeze, and this was associated with wheezy [odds ratio (OR), 3.4 (1.2-9.7); P = .02] and/or febrile LRI [OR, 3.9 (1.4-10.5); P = .007], in particular those caused by respiratory syncytial virus or rhinoviruses [OR, 4.1 (1.3-12.6); P = .02]. Comparable findings were made for current asthma. Strikingly these associations were restricted to children who displayed early sensitization (\u22642 years old) and not observed in nonatopic patients or those sensitized later. Conclusion: These data suggest viral infections interact with atopy in infancy to promote later asthma. Notably the occurrence of both of these events during this narrow developmental window is associated with maximal risk for subsequent asthma, which suggests a contribution from both classes of inflammatory insults to disease pathogenesis. Clinical implications: Protection of \"high-risk\" children against the effects of severe respiratory infections during infancy may represent an effective strategy for primary asthma prevention. The potential benefits of these strategies merit more careful evaluation in this age group.", "date": "2007", "authors": ["Merci M.H.

Here, a viral metagenomic analysis of 268 bat rectal swabs collected from four counties in Yunnan Province has identified hundreds of sequences relating to alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed that alphacoronaviruses had diversities with some obvious differences from those reported previously. Full genomic analysis of a new SARS-like CoV from Baoshan (LYRa11) showed that it was 29,805 nucleotides (nt) in length with 13 open reading frames (ORFs), sharing 91% nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367, while sharing 89% with other bat SARS-like CoVs. Notably, it showed the highest sequence identity with the S gene of SARS CoVs and Rs3367, especially in the RBD region. Antigenic analysis showed that the S1 domain of LYRa11 could be efficiently recognized by SARS-convalescent human serum, indicating that LYRa11 is a novel virus antigenically close to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is likely a recombinant descended from parental lineages that had evolved into a number of bat SARS-like CoVs. Importance Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been discovered in bats worldwide, there are significant different genic structures, particularly in the S1 domain, which are responsible for host tropism determination, between bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS CoVs, indicating that most reported bat SARS-like CoVs are not the progenitors of human SARS CoV. We have identified diverse alphacoronaviruses and a close relative (LYRa11) to SARS CoV in bats collected in Yunnan, China. Further analysis showed that alpha- and betacoronaviruses have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. Notably, full genomic sequencing and antigenic study demonstrated that LYRa11 is phylogenetically and antigenically closely related to SARS CoV.

Tissue lead concentrations in three populations from London increased progressively with proximity to the city centre, where markedly elevated values were recorded and where females contained higher bone levels than males. No organolead was detected in any of the tissues examined. The cadmium content of central London birds was also greater than in the suburban sample, but birds from the outer urban site, Heathrow Airport, also contained elevated cadmium; aircraft were considered as a possible source of this contamination. The differences in tissue metal content between populations corresponded to the levels encountered in the intestine contents; by feeding at ground level the species is probably ingesting food contaminated with roadside dust. Lead and cadmium toxicity in this species was discussed in relation to the possible antagonistic role of zinc. The ability of an urban-dwelling organism to accumulate elevated lead concentrations draws attention to the potential hazard of children ingesting street dust from such areas. It is suggested that the feral pigeon may be used both to monitor urban lead contamination and as a model for chronic lead toxicity.", "date": "1980", "authors": ["M. Hutton , G.T.

The intent was to provide clear images of the droplet structure during the deformation process. The ambient pressure (0.101 MPa), surface material (polished stainless steel), initial droplet diameter (about 1.5 mm), liquid (n-heptane) and impact Weber number (43) were fixed. The primary parameter was the surface temperature, which ranged from 24 degrees C to above the Leidenfrost temperature of the liquid. Experiments were also performed on a droplet impacting a surface on which there existed a liquid film created by deposition of a prior droplet. The evolution of wetted area and spreading rate, both of a droplet on a stainless steel surface and of a droplet spreading over a thin liquid film, were found to be independent of surface temperature during the early period of impact. This result was attributed to negligible surface tension and viscous effects, and in consequence the measurements made during the early period of the impact process were in good agreement with previously published analyses which neglected these effects. A single bubble was observed to form within the droplet during impact at low temperatures. As surface temperature was increased the population of bubbles within the droplet also increased because of progressive activation of nucleation sites on the stainless steel surface. At surface temperatures near to the boiling point of heptane, a spoke-like cellular structure in the liquid was created during the spreading process by coalescence of a ring of bubbles that had formed within the droplet. At higher temperatures, but below the Leidenfrost point, numerous bubbles appeared within the droplet, yet the overall droplet shape, particularly in the early stages of impact (< 0.8 ms), was unaffected by the presence of these bubbles.

For descrip- tors at interest points to be robustly matched between images, they must be as far as possible invariant to the imaging process. In this work we introduce a family of features which use groups of interest points to form geometrically invariant descriptors of image regions. Feature descriptors are formed by resampling the image rel- ative to canonical frames de\u00afned by the points. In addition to robust matching, a key advantage of this approach is that each match implies a hypothesis of the local 2D (projective) transformation.

The intent is to provide a roadmap for the individual chapters that follow, rather than define terms and explain principles in any detail. 2 Streamflow Fluvial ecosystems exhibit tremendous variability in the quantity, timing and temporal patterns of river flow, and this profoundly influences their physical, chemical and biological condition. This chapter covers the essentials of hydrology, from the global water cycle to the myriad ways that humans alter water flowpaths and river flow. 3 Fluvial Geomorphology Fluvial geomorphology emphasizes the dynamic interplay between rivers and landscapes in the shaping of river channels and drainage networks. It includes study of the linkages among channel, floodplain, network and catchment and helps make sense of the enormous variety exhibited among fluvial systems, and thus the habitat and environmental conditions experienced by the biota. 4 Streamwater Chemistry The constituents of river water include suspended inorganic matter, dissolved major ions, dissolved nutrients, suspended and dissolved organic matter, gases, and trace metals. River chemistry changes temporally under the multiple influences of seasonal changes in discharge regime, precipitation inputs, and biological activity and usually is greatly altered owing to direct and indirect human influences. 5 The Abiotic Environment The abiotic environment includes all physical and chemical variables that influence the distribution and abundance of organisms. Current, substrate and temperature often are the most important variables in fluvial environments, and all organisms show adaptations that limit them to a subset of conditions. Species differ in the specific conditions under which they thrive, and whether those conditionsare narrow or comparatively broad. 6 Primary Producers Primary producers acquire their energy from sunlight and their materials from nonliving sources. The major autotrophs of running waters include the benthic algae and macrophytes in larger rivers, phytoplankton also can be important. Benthic algae occur in intimate association with heterotrophic microbes within an extracellular matrix, referred to as biofilm. Benthic algae are important in fluvial food webs, especially in headwater and midsized streams, and also influence the benthic habitat and nutrient cycling. 7 Detrital Energy Sources Particulate and dissolved organic matter originating both within the stream and in the surrounding landscape is an important basal resource to fluvial food webs. Detritus-based energy pathways can be particularly important, relative to pathways originating from living primary producers, in small streams shaded by a terrestrial canopy and in large, turbid rivers with extensive floodplains. Recent advances in microbial ecology have greatly expanded our understanding of the synergies between autotrophs and heterotrophs. 8 Trophic Relationships The network of consumers and resources that constitute fluvial food webs is supported by a diverse mix of energy supplies that originate within the stream and beyond its banks. These include the living resources of algae and macrophytes, and the non-living resources of particulate and dissolved organic matter. Microorganisms are important mediators of organic matter availability and there is increasing evidence of their importance as a resource to both small and large consumers. Additionally, energy subsidies in the form of falling terrestrial arthropods and the eggs and carcasses of migrating fish contribute to the support of many stream-dwellers. 9 Species interactions The basal resources of algae and detritus and associated microorganisms sustain higher consumers includin", "date": "1994", "authors": ["J.

Experiments evaluating the production and function of IL-12 demonstrated the induction of biologically active factor early during Smith strain MCMV, but not Armstrong strain LCMV, infection. The MCMV-induced IL-12 was responsible for early NK cell IFN-gamma production and viral control, as in vivo IL-12 neutralization by Ab treatment blocked both of these. In contrast, NK cell IFN-gamma production could not be detected during LCMV infection, and IL-12 neutralization had no effect on early LCMV replication.

On a weight basis (1 microgram/kg) rTNF alpha and rIL-1 produce the same amount of fever and induce comparable levels of PGE2 in rabbit hypothalamic cells in vitro; like IL-1, TNF fever is blocked by drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase. At higher doses (10 micrograms/kg) rTNF alpha produces biphasic fevers. The first fever reaches peak elevation 45-55 min after bolus injection and likely represents a direct action on the thermoregulatory center. During the second fever peak (3 h later), a circulating endogenous pyrogen can be shown present using passive transfer of plasma into fresh rabbits. This likely represents the in vivo induction of IL-1. In vitro, rTNF alpha induces the release of IL-1 activity from human mononuclear cells with maximal production observed at 50-100 ng/ml of rTNF alpha. In addition, rTNF alpha and rIFN-gamma have a synergistic effect on IL-1 production. The biological activity of rTNF alpha could be distinguished from IL-1 in three ways: the monophasic pyrogenic activity of rIL-1 was destroyed at 70 degrees C, whereas rTNF alpha remained active; anti-IL-1 neutralized IL-1 but did recognize rTNF alpha or natural cachectin nor neutralize its cytotoxic effect; and unlike IL-1, rTNF alpha was not active in the mitogen-stimulated T cell proliferation assay. The possibility that endotoxin was responsible for rTNF alpha fever and/or the induction of IL-1 was ruled-out in several studies: rTNF alpha produced fever in the endotoxin-resistant C3H/HeJ mice; the IL-1-inducing property of rTNF alpha was destroyed either by heat (70 degrees C) or trypsinization, and was unaffected by polymyxin B; pyrogenic tolerance to daily injections of rTNF alpha did not occur; levels of endotoxin, as determined in the Limulus amebocyte lysate, were below the minimum rabbit pyrogen dose; and these levels of endotoxin were confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis for the presence of beta-hydroxymyristic acid. Although rTNF alpha is not active in T cell proliferation assays, it may mimic IL-1 in a T cell assay, since high concentrations of rTNF alpha induced IL-1 from epithelial or macrophagic cells in the thymocyte preparations. These studies show that TNF (cachectin) is another endogenous pyrogen which, like IL-1 and IFN-alpha, directly stimulate hypothalamic PGE2 synthesis.

His ideas have had a profound impact on many fields - including business, medicine, and politics - but until now, he has never brought together his many years of research in one book. In \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\", Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think and make choices. One system is fast, intuitive, and emotional; the other is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities - and also the faults and biases - of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behaviour. The importance of properly framing risks, the effects of cognitive biases on how we view others, the dangers of prediction, the right ways to develop skills, the pros and cons of fear and optimism, the difference between our experience and memory of events, the real components of happiness - each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions. Drawing on a lifetime's experimental experience, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking.

Emergence of drug-resistant influenza viruses after treatment has been reported, particularly in children in Japan, where the dosing schedule is different from that used throughout the rest of the world. We investigated the emergence of drug-resistant infection in children treated with a tiered weight-based dosing regimen. Methods We analyzed sequential clinical nasopharyngeal samples, obtained before and after tiered weight-based oseltamivir therapy, from children with acute influenza during 2005-2007. We isolated viruses, tested for drug resistance with use of a fluorescence-based neuraminidase inhibition assay, performed neuraminidase gene sequencing, and determined quantitative viral loads. Results Sixty-four children (34 with influenza A subtype H3N2, 11 with influenza A subtype H1N1, and 19 with influenza B virus) aged 1-12 years (median age, 3 years, 1 month) were enrolled. By days 4-7 after initiation of treatment, of 64 samples tested, 47 (73.4%) and 26 (40.6%) had virus detectable by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and culture, respectively. By days 8-12 after initiation of treatment, of 53 samples tested, 18 (33.9%) and 1 (1.8%) had virus detectable by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and culture, respectively. We found no statistically significant differences in the reduction of viral shedding or time to clearance of virus between viral subtypes. Antiviral-resistant viruses were recovered from 3 (27.3%) of 11 children with influenza A subtype H1N1, 1 (2.9%) of 34 children with influenza A subtype H3N2, and 0 (0%) of 19 children with influenza B virus, all of whom were treated with oseltamivir (P = .004). There was no evidence of prolonged illness in children infected with drug-resistant virus. Conclusions Drug resistance emerges at a higher rate in influenza A subtype H1N1 virus than in influenza A subtype H3N2 or influenza B virus after tiered weight-based oseltamivir therapy.

High levels of morbidity caused by adenovirus among US military recruits have returned since the loss of adenovirus vaccines in 1999. The transmission dynamics of adenovirus have never been well understood, which complicates prevention efforts. Methods. Enrollment and end-of-study samples were obtained and active surveillance for febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) was performed for 341 recruits and support personnel. Environmental samples were collected simultaneously. Classic and advanced diagnostic techniques were used. Results. Seventy-nine percent (213/271) of new recruits were seronegative for either adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad-4) or adenovirus serotype 7 (Ad-7). FRI caused by Ad-4 was observed in 25% (67/271) of enrolled recruits, with 100% of them occurring in individuals with enrollment titers <1:4. The percentage of recruits seropositive for Ad-4 increased from 34% at enrollment to 97% by the end of the study. Adenovirus was most commonly detected in the environment on pillows, lockers, and rifles. Conclusions. Potential sources of adenovirus transmission among US military recruits included the presence of adenovirus on surfaces in living quarters and extended pharyngeal viral shedding over the course of several days. The introduction of new recruits, who were still shedding adenovirus, into new training groups was documented.

We performed a retrospective cohort study, in seven intensive care units in a single tertiary care academic center, on 5,383 patients admitted during a one year period (1 July 2000\u201330 June 2001). Acute kidney injury occurred in 67% of intensive care unit admissions, with maximum RIFLE class R, class I and class F in 12%, 27% and 28%, respectively.

Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion. Conclusions and Relevance In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.", "date": "2020", "authors": ["Chenguang Shen 1, Zhaoqin Wang 1, Fang Zhao 1, Yang Yang 1, Jinxiu Li 1, Jing Yuan 1, Fuxiang Wang 1, Delin Li 1, 2, Minghui Yang 1, Li Xing 1, Jinli Wei 1, Haixia Xiao 1, 2, Yan Yang 1, Jiuxin Qu 1, Ling Qing 1, Li Chen 1, Zhixiang Xu 1, Ling Peng 1, Yanjie Li 1, Haixia Zheng 1, Feng Chen 1, Kun Huang 1, Yujing Jiang 1, Dongjing Liu 1, Zheng Zhang 1, Yingxia Liu 1, Lei Liu 1"], "related_topics": ["SOFA score", "ARDS", "Viral load", "Titer", "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation", "Mechanical ventilation", "Pneumonia", "Methylprednisolone", "Anesthesia", "Medicine"], "citation_count": "1,898", "reference_count": "24", "references": ["3001118548", "3008028633", "3003322996", "3008954191", "2148822770", "1996311210", "2225294925", "2096238447", "3035928876", "2057439500"]}, {"id": "2113521108", "title": "Tree allometry and improved estimation of carbon stocks and balance in tropical forests", "abstract": "Tropical forests hold large stores of carbon, yet uncertainty remains regarding their quantitative contri- bution to the global carbon cycle.

Printing telegraph is an outstanding example. Here, time is divided into equal divisions, and the number of magnitudes to be distinguished in any one interval is usually no more than two, corresponding to the closed or open positions of a sending switch. It is only in recent years, however, that the development of high speed electronic devices has progressed sufficiently to enable quantizing techniques to be applied to rapidly changing signals such as produced by speech, music, or television. Quantizing of time, or time division, has found application as a means of multiplexing telephone channels.1 The method consists of connecting the different channels to the line in sequence by fast moving switches synchronized at the transmitting and receiving ends. In this way a transmission medium capable of handling a much wider band of frequencies than required for one telephone channel can be used simultaneously by a group of channels without mutual interference. The plan is the same as that used in multiplex telegraphy. The difference is that ordinary rotating machinery suffices at the relatively low speeds employed by the latter, while the high speeds needed for time division multiplex telephony can be realized only by practically inertialess electron streams. Also the widths of frequency band required for multiplex telephony are enormously greater than needed for the telegraph, and in fact have become technically feasible only with the development of wide-band radio and cable transmission systems. As far as any one channel is concerned the result is the same as in telegraphy, namely that signals are received at discrete or quantized times. In the limiting case when many channels are sent the speech voltage from one channel is practically constant during the brief switch closure and, in effect, we can send only one magnitude for each contact or quantum of time.

Originally isolated from mammals, polyomavirus sequences have now been detected in invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds, although it remains to be determined whether all these animals are genuine hosts. The genomes of all polyomaviruses encode at least two regulatory proteins (large and small tumour antigen) and two structural proteins (capsid proteins VP1 and VP2) whose functions have been defined. The large and small tumour antigens have domains conserved among the polyomaviruses, which are responsible for specific interactions with cellular proteins and may result in alteration of the cell cycle. Additional open reading frames (ORFs) are present in the genomes of the different polyomavirus species. Some of these ORFs are transcribed and translated in viral proteins, but their functions remain poorly understood. Polyomaviruses have a restricted host specificity. This may indicate that co-divergence with their hosts, which has been demonstrated in a few cases, was an important factor during polyomavirus diversification. However, a strict co-divergence scenario fails to explain family-wide patterns of diversity, suggesting an important contribution of lineage duplication and, possibly to a lesser extent, recombination and cross-species transmission. Polyomaviruses are pathogens that can cause various malignant and non-malignant diseases in birds and mammals, including humans, but so far they have not been linked to disease in lower vertebrates. In immunosuppressed individuals, reactivation of polyomavirus BK or JC can cause serious disease of the urogenital tract and brain, respectively, while Merkel cell polyomavirus is most probably associated with the development of a highly aggressive neuroendocrine skin tumour in elderly or patients with pre-existing conditions.

Oceanic O2 fluxes for the 1860\u20132100 period are simulated using a coupled climate model in which is nested an ocean biogeochemistry model. Simulated oceanic O2 fluxes exhibit large interannual (\u00b140 Tmol yr\u22121) and decadal (\u00b113 Tmol yr\u22121) variability, as well as a net outgassing to the atmosphere caused by climate change (up to 125 Tmol yr\u22121 by 2100). Roughly one quarter of this outgassing is caused by warming of the ocean surface, and the remainder is caused by ocean stratification. The global oceanic O2 and heat fluxes are strongly correlated for both the decadal variations and the climate trend. Using the observed heat fluxes and the modeled O2 flux/heat flux relationship, we infer the contribution of the oceans to atmospheric O2 and infer a correction to the partitioning of the ocean and land CO2 sinks. After considering this correction, the ocean and land sinks are 1.8 \u00b1 0.8 Pg C yr\u22121 and 0.3 \u00b1 0.9 Pg C yr\u22121, respectively, for the 1980s (a correction of 0.1 from ocean to land) and are 2.3 \u00b1 0.7 Pg C yr\u22121 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.9 Pg C yr\u22121, respectively, in the 1990\u20131996 period (a correction of 0.5 from land to ocean).

In graph embedding, each algorithm can be considered as the direct graph embedding or its linear/kernel/tensor extension of a specific intrinsic graph that describes certain desired statistical or geometric properties of a data set, with constraints from scale normalization or a penalty graph that characterizes a statistical or geometric property that should be avoided. Furthermore, the graph embedding framework can be used as a general platform for developing new dimensionality reduction algorithms. By utilizing this framework as a tool, we propose a new supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called marginal Fisher analysis in which the intrinsic graph characterizes the intraclass compactness and connects each data point with its neighboring points of the same class, while the penalty graph connects the marginal points and characterizes the interclass separability.

Most retrospective and prospective studies show that after the introduction of an antibiotic not only the level of resistance of pathogenic bacteria, but also of commensal bacteria increases. Commensal bacteria constitute a reservior of resistance genes for (potentially) pathogenic bacteria. Their level of resistance is considered to be a good indicator for selection pressure by antibiotic use and for resistance problems to be expected in pathogens. Resistant commensal bacteria of food animals might contaminate, like zoonotic bacteria, meat (products) and so reach the intestinal tract of humans. Monitoring the prevalence of resistance in indicator bacteria such as faecal Escherichia coli and enterococci in different populations, animals, patients and healthy humans, makes it feasible to compare the prevalence of resistance and to detect transfer of resistant bacteria or resistance genes from animals to humans and vice versa. Only in countries that use or used avoparcin (a glycopeptide antibiotic, like vancomycin) as antimicrobial growth promoter (AMGP), is vancomycin resistance common in intestinal enterococci, not only in exposed animals, but also in the human population outside hospitals. Resistance genes against antibiotics, that are or have only been used in animals, i.e. nourseothricin, apramycin etc. were found soon after their introduction, not only in animal bacteria but also in the commensal flora of humans, in zoonotic pathogens like salmonellae, but also in strictly human pathogens, like shigellae. This makes it clear that not only clonal spread of resistant strains occurs, but also transfer of resistance genes between human and animal bacteria. Moreover, since the EU ban of avoparcin, a significant decrease has been observed in several European countries in the prevalence of vancomycin resistant enterococci in meat (products), in faecal samples of food animals and healthy humans, which underlines the role of antimicrobial usage in food animals in the selection of bacterial resistance and the transport of these resistances via the food chain to humans. To safeguard public health, the selection and dissemination of resistant bacteria from animals should be controlled. This can only be achieved by reducing the amounts of antibiotics used in animals. Discontinuing the practice of routinely adding AMGP to animal feeds would reduce the amounts of antibiotics used for animals in the EU by a minimum of 30% and in some member states even by 50%.", "date": "2000", "authors": ["A E van den Bogaard , E E Stobberingh"], "related_topics": ["Antibiotic resistance", "Avoparcin", "Pathogenic bacteria"], "citation_count": "1,296", "reference_count": "64", "references": ["2323555722", "2041278074", "2010504473", "2040630478", "2096174565", "3021344764", "2101273200", "2128483719", "2113691563", "2013612076"]}, {"id": "2125054694", "title": "A fluorimetric method for the estimation of G+C mol% content in microorganisms by thermal denaturation temperature.", "abstract": "G+C mol% content in microorganisms is one of the recommended characteristics for the standard description of bacterial species.

These enzymes target polysaccharides from terrestrial plants that dominated diet throughout human evolution. The array of CAZymes in gut microbes is highly diverse, exemplified by the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which contains 261 glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases, as well as 208 homologues of susC and susD-genes coding for two outer membrane proteins involved in starch utilization. A fundamental question that, to our knowledge, has yet to be addressed is how this diversity evolved by acquiring new genes from microbes living outside the gut. Here we characterize the first porphyranases from a member of the marine Bacteroidetes, Zobellia galactanivorans, active on the sulphated polysaccharide porphyran from marine red algae of the genus Porphyra. Furthermore, we show that genes coding for these porphyranases, agarases and associated proteins have been transferred to the gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius isolated from Japanese individuals. Our comparative gut metagenome analyses show that porphyranases and agarases are frequent in the Japanese population and that they are absent in metagenome data from North American individuals. Seaweeds make an important contribution to the daily diet in Japan (14.2 g per person per day), and Porphyra spp. (nori) is the most important nutritional seaweed, traditionally used to prepare sushi.

We show that human colon cancer tissues contain distinct cell populations whose transcriptional identities mirror those of the different cellular lineages of normal colon. By creating monoclonal tumor xenografts from injection of a single (n = 1) cell, we demonstrate that the transcriptional diversity of cancer tissues is largely explained by in vivo multilineage differentiation and not only by clonal genetic heterogeneity.

For a valuable quality assessment, relevant data on outcome must be obtained in a standardized and reproducible manner to allow comparison among different centers, between different therapies and within a center over time.1\u20133 Objective and reliable outcome data are increasingly requested by patients and payers (government or private insurance) to assess quality and costs of health care. Moreover, health policy makers point out that the availability of comparative data on individual hospital's and physician's performance represents a powerful market force, which may contribute to limit the costs of health care while improving quality.4 Conclusive assessments of surgical procedures remain limited by the lack of consensus on how to define complications and to stratify them by severity.1,5\u20138 In 1992, we proposed general principles to classify complications of surgery based on a therapy-oriented, 4-level severity grading.1 Subsequently, the severity grading was refined and applied to compare the results of laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy9 and liver transplantation.10 This classification has also been used by others11\u201313 and was recently suggested to serve as the basis to assess the outcome of living related liver transplantation in the United States (J. Trotter, personal communication). However, the classification system has not yet been widely used in the surgical literature. The strength of the previous classification relied on the principle of grading complications based on the therapy used to treat the complication. This approach allows identification of most complications and prevents down-rating of major negative outcomes. This is particularly important in retrospective analyses. However, we felt that modifications were necessary, particularly in grading life-threatening complications and long-term disability due to a complication. We also felt that the duration of the hospital stay can no longer be used as a criterion to grade complications. Although definitions of negative outcomes rely to a large extend on subjective \u201cvalue\u201d appraisals, the grading system must be tested in a large cohort of patients. Finally, a classification is useful only if widely accepted and applied throughout different countries and surgical cultures. Such a validation was not done with the previous classification. Therefore, the aim of the current study was 3-fold: first, to propose an improved classification of surgical complications based on our experience gained with the previous classification1; second, to test this classification in a large cohort of patients who underwent general surgery; and third, to assess the reproducibility and acceptability of the classification through an international survey.", "date": "2004", "authors": ["Daniel Dindo , Nicolas Demartines , Pierre Alain Clavien"], "related_topics": ["Clavien-Dindo Classification", "Health care", "Health policy", "Cohort study", "Grading (education)", "Cohort", "Public health", "MEDLINE", "Intensive care medicine", "Medicine", "Surgery"], "citation_count": "20,349", "reference_count": "30", "references": ["2037377025", "2156202966", "87919420/r", "2292623833", "2072867503", "2064415455", "2123834062", "2135384303", "1799620269", "2005508348"]}, {"id": "1941129807", "title": "Detection of Lassa Virus Antinucleoprotein Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM Antibodies by a Simple Recombinant Immunoblot Assay for Field Use", "abstract": "The nucleoprotein of Lassa virus, strain Josiah, was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminally truncated, histidine-tagged recombinant protein.

A panel of 913 serum specimens from regions in which Lassa virus was endemic and from regions in which Lassa virus was not endemic was used for evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of the LVA immunoblot in comparison to those of an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay. The sera originated from field studies conducted in the Republic of Guinea (570 serum samples) and Liberia (99 serum samples), from inpatients of the clinical department of the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute, Hamburg, Germany (94 serum samples), and from healthy German blood donors (150 serum samples). In comparison to the IIF assay the LVA immunoblot assay had a specificity of 90.0 to 99.3%, depending on the origin of the specimens.

Seven PCR-negative patients were reactive by immunoblotting. The positive and negative predictive values of a single IgM immunoblot result for acute, PCR-confirmed Lassa fever were therefore 53.6 and 93.0%, respectively.

A draft definition proposed 3 mutually exclusive categories of ARDS based on degree of hypoxemia: mild (200 mm Hg < PaO2/FIO2 \u2264 300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg < PaO2/FIO2 \u2264 200 mm Hg), and severe (PaO2/FIO2 \u2264 100 mm Hg) and 4 ancillary variables for severe ARDS: radiographic severity, respiratory system compliance (\u226440 mL/cm H2O), positive end-expiratory pressure (\u226510 cm H2O), and corrected expired volume per minute (\u226510 L/min). The draft Berlin Definition was empirically evaluated using patient-level meta-analysis of 4188 patients with ARDS from 4 multicenter clinical data sets and 269 patients with ARDS from 3 single-center data sets containing physiologic information. The 4 ancillary variables did not contribute to the predictive validity of severe ARDS for mortality and were removed from the definition. Using the Berlin Definition, stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS were associated with increased mortality (27%; 95% CI, 24%-30%; 32%; 95% CI, 29%-34%; and 45%; 95% CI, 42%-48%, respectively; P < .001) and increased median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors (5 days; interquartile [IQR], 2-11; 7 days; IQR, 4-14; and 9 days; IQR, 5-17, respectively; P < .001).

Accordingly, research guided by self-determination theo~ has focused on the social-contextual conditions that facilitate versus forestall the natural processes of self-motivation and healthy psychological development. Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs--competence, autonomy, and relatednesswhich when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy. T he fullest representations of humanity show people to be curious, vital, and self-motivated. At their best, they are agentic and inspired, striving to learn; extend themselves; master new skills; and apply their talents responsibly. That most people show considerable effort, agency, and commitment in their lives appears, in fact, to be more normative than exceptional, suggesting some very positive and persistent features of human nature. Yet, it is also clear that the human spirit can be diminished or crushed and that individuals sometimes reject growth and responsibility. Regardless of social strata or cultural origin, examples of both children and adults who are apathetic, alienated, and irresponsible are abundant. Such non-optimal human functioning can be observed not only in our psychological clinics but also among the millions who, for hours a day, sit passively before their televisions, stare blankly from the back of their classrooms, or wait listlessly for the weekend as they go about their jobs. The persistent, proactive, and positive tendencies of human nature are clearly not invariantly apparent. The fact that human nature, phenotypically expressed, can be either active or passive, constructive or indolent, suggests more than mere dispositional differences and is a function of more than just biological endowments. It also bespeaks a wide range of reactions to social environments that is worthy of our most intense scientific investigation. Specifically, social contexts catalyze both within- and between-person differences in motivation and personal growth, resulting in people being more self-motivated, energized, and integrated in some situations, domains, and cultures than in others. Research on the conditions that foster versus undermine positive human potentials has both theoretical import and practical significance because it can contribute not only to formal knowledge of the causes of human behavior but also to the design of social environments that optimize people's development, performance, and well-being.

These viral enzymes are essential for the release of virus from infected cells, and they may also reduce the inactivation of virus by respiratory secretions. When administered experimentally directly to the respiratory tract, zanamivir has potent antiviral effects. We assessed the therapeutic activity of zanamivir in adults with acute influenza. Methods We conducted separate randomized, double-blind studies in 38 centers in North America and 32 centers in Europe during the influenza season of 1994-1995. A total of 417 adults with influenza-like illness of <48 hours' duration were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: 6.4 mg of zanamivir by intranasal spray plus 10 mg by inhalation, 10 mg of zanamivir by inhalation plus placebo spray, or placebo by both routes. Treatments were self-administered twice daily for five days. Results Of 262 patients with confirmed influenzavirus infection (63 percent of all patients), the median length of time to the alleviation of all major symptoms was one day shorter (four days vs. five days) in the 88 patients given inhaled and intranasal zanamivir (P=0.02) and the 85 patients given inhaled zanamivir alone (P=0.05) than in the 89 patients given placebo. Among the infected patients who were febrile at enrollment and among those who began treatment within 30 hours after the onset of symptoms, the median time to the alleviation of major symptoms was four days in both zanamivir groups and seven days in the placebo group (P<0.01). Viral titers of nasal washings in the group given inhaled and intranasal zanamivir were significantly lower than those in the placebo group. The topically administered zanamivir was well tolerated. Conclusions In adults with influenza A or B virus infections, direct administration of a selective neuraminidase inhibitor, zanamivir, to the respiratory tract is safe and reduces symptoms if begun early.

Therefore, we investigated the involvement in these leukemias and lymphomas of the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) that was previously isolated in one of our laboratories from cultured T cells of some patients in the United States with leukemias and lymphomas involving relatively mature T cells. High titers of antibodies capable of quantitative precipitation of 125I-labeled p24, a well characterized core protein of HTLV, were detected in 12 of 12 patients with untreated adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). (One negative was a patient on chemotherapy.) Ten of the 12 positive samples were from an area where the disease is endemic. Strong precipitating antibodies were also detected in five of seven cases of T-cell malignant lymphoma (TML) which differs from ATL by having fewer leukemic cells in the peripheral blood. High antibody titers were also observed in one of five cases of acute monoblastic leukemia and one of eight cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia in the blast phase of the disease. Low to moderate titers of antibodies were detected in several categories of leukemia (two cases of blast-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, two cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia of the null-cell type, and one case of acute myelogenous leukemia). Among all categories of leukemias, except ATL and TML, more cases were negative than positive for anti-p24 activity. All of 79 sera from normal Japanese, including 39 collected from the endemic ATL area of southwest Japan, were negative for antibodies to HTLV p24. All the positive reactivities observed were highly specific to HTLV. The only competition observed in the precipitation of HTLV p24 was with HTLV or with cell lines expressing HTLV and not with various animal retroviruses or a large number of human and subhuman primate cell lines, not known to be producing HTLV.

However, proviral DNA synthesis is not required for cell fusion since the addition of cytosine arabinoside has no significant effect on multinucleate cell formation at concentrations which inhibit virus replication. This result indicates that virus replication is not required for multinucleate cell formation and that the two are independent events of virus infection. The addition of cycloheximide during the first 12 hr of infection, on the other hand, significantly reduces cell fusion, indicating that de novo protein synthesis is required. The possibility that cell fusion involves translation of input viral RNA is discussed. Pre-infection of target cells with the replicating component of M-PMV blocks fusion by all three D-type viruses. The degree of interference observed correlates with the molecular relatedness of the three viruses.", "date": "1980", "authors": ["S. Chatterjee , E.

We now report that GS 4071 is active against several strains of influenza A and B viruses in vitro and that oral GS 4104, an ethyl ester prodrug which is converted to GS 4071 in vivo, is active in the mouse and ferret models of influenza virus infection. Oral administration of 10 mg of GS 4104 per kg of body weight per day caused a 100-fold reduction in lung homogenate viral titers and enhanced survival in mice infected with influenza A or B viruses. In ferrets, a 25-mg/kg dose of GS 4104 given twice daily reduced peak viral titers in nasal washings and eliminated constitutional responses to influenza virus infection including fever, increased nasal signs (sneezing, nasal discharge, mouth breathing), and decreased activity. Consistent with our demonstration that the parent compound is highly specific for influenza virus neuraminidases, no significant drug-related toxicity was observed after the administration of oral dosages of GS 4104 of up to 800 mg/kg/day for 14 days in nonclinical toxicology studies with rats.

Furthering these efforts and building on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, an international group of experts has created a guideline to improve the transparency, accuracy, completeness, and frequency of documented systematic review and meta-analysis protocols--PRISMA-P (for protocols) 2015.

Six contiguous stretches of sequence (contigs) containing approximately 5.5 Mb of DNA were isolated. Subclones from these contigs were used to identify and position six genes, all of which were expressed in normal colonic mucosa. Two of these genes (APC and MCC) are likely to contribute to colorectal tumorigenesis. The MCC gene had previously been identified by virtue of its mutation in human colorectal tumors. The APC gene was identified in a contig initiated from the MCC gene and was found to encode an unusually large protein.

Methods We analysed epidemiological information and collected serum and nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with SARS in Guangdong in mid-February, 2003. We did virus isolation, serological tests, and molecular assays to identify the causative agent. Findings SARS had been circulating in other cities of Guangdong Province for about 2 months before causing a major outbreak in Guangzhou, the province's capital. A novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (CoV), was isolated from specimens from three patients with SARS. Viral antigens were also directly detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from these patients. 48 of 55 (87%) patients had antibodies to SARS CoV in their convalescent sera. Genetic analysis showed that the SARS CoV isolates from Guangzhou shared the same origin with those in other countries, and had a phylogenetic pathway that matched the spread of SARS to the other parts of the world.

Most studies have focused on hospitalized children or children from closed populations. It is essential that the viral etiology of these clinical diseases be accurately defined in the development of antiviral drugs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of all common respiratory viruses as upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens in the first year of life. STUDY DESIGN: This community-based birth cohort study prospectively collected detailed information on all ARI contracted by 263 infants from birth until 1 year of age. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected for each ARI episode, and all common respiratory viruses were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Episodes were classified as upper respiratory illnesses or lower respiratory illnesses (LRI), with or without wheeze. RESULTS: The majority reported 2-5 episodes of ARI in the first year (range, 0-11 episodes; mean, 4.1). One-third were LRI, and 29% of these were associated with wheeze. Viruses were detected in 69% of ARI; most common were rhinoviruses (48.5%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (10.9%). Compared with RSV, >10 times the number of upper respiratory illnesses and >3 times the number of both LRI and wheezing LRI were attributed to rhinoviruses. CONCLUSION: Rhinoviruses are the major upper and lower respiratory pathogens in the first year of life. Although RSV is strongly associated with severe LRI requiring hospitalization, the role of rhinoviruses as the major lower respiratory pathogens in infants has not previously been recognized.", "date": "2006", "authors": ["Merci M.

Originally, it was accepted that the yield stress of a solid was essentially the point at which, when the applied stress was increased, the deforming solid first began to show liquid-like behaviour, i.e. continual deformation. In the same way, the yield stress of a structured liquid was originally seen as the point at which, when decreasing the applied stress, solid-like behaviour was first noticed, i.e. no continual deformation. However as time went on, and experimental capabilities increased, it became clear, first for solids and lately for soft solids and structured liquids, that although there is usually a small range of stress over which the mechanical properties change dramatically (an apparent yield stress), these materials nevertheless show slow but continual steady deformation when stressed for a long time below this level, having shown an initial linear elastic response to the applied stress. At the lowest stresses, this creep behaviour for solids, soft solids and structured liquids can be described by a Newtonian-plateau viscosity. As the stress is increased the flow behaviour usually changes into a power-law dependence of steady-state shear rate on shear stress. For structured liquids and soft solids, this behaviour generally gives way to Newtonian behaviour at the highest stresses. For structured liquids this transition from very high (creep) viscosity (>106 Pa.s) to mobile liquid (", "date": "1999", "authors": ["Howard A.

Starting from estimation-theoretic foundations of this problem, the paper proves that a solution to the SLAM problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the SLAM problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed. It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded estimate of vehicle location. The paper also describes a substantial implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a vehicle operating in an outdoor environment using millimeter-wave radar to provide relative map observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a practical environment.

As experience has accumulated with placement and maintenance of vena caval catheters, various associated complications have become apparent. During recent months it seemed that complications were occurring at a rate out of proportion to the increased frequency with which we were employing this modality. Subsequent review of our experience with more than 350 central venous cannulations disclosed that preventable complications can be attributed to two primary factors; a more relaxed attitude toward critical points of catheter placement as an individual or group attains experience with this modality, and delegation of catheter care to nonsurgical personnel after a polyethylene cannula has been inserted. Prolonged central venous cannulation can be accomplished with minimal sequelae, if careful and persistent attention is directed toward certain details of catheter placement and maintenance. Herein we have outlined and emphasized precautions which will preclude occurrence of the most dangerous complications, and minimize the frequency with which the others occur. When employed with proper care, few untoward sequelae will detract from the over-all value of central venous cannulation, a proven clinical adjunct in the management of critically ill patients.", "date": "1972", "authors": ["J.

Identifying the causative agent of a new epidemic is one of the most important steps for effective response to disease outbreaks. Traditionally, virus discovery required propagation of the virus in cell culture, a proven technique responsible for the identification of the vast majority of viruses known to date. However, many viruses cannot be easily propagated in cell culture, thus limiting our knowledge of viruses. Viral metagenomic analyses of environmental samples suggest that the field of virology has explored less than 1% of the extant viral diversity. In the last decade, the culture-independent and sequence-independent metagenomic approach has permitted the discovery of many viruses in a wide range of samples. Phylogenetically, some of these viruses are distantly related to previously discovered viruses. In addition, 60-99% of the sequences generated in different viral metagenomic studies are not homologous to known viruses. In this review, we discuss the advances in the area of viral metagenomics during the last decade and their relevance to virus discovery, clinical microbiology and public health. We discuss the potential of metagenomics for characterization of the normal viral population in a healthy community and identification of viruses that could pose a threat to humans through zoonosis. In addition, we propose a new model of the Koch's postulates named the 'Metagenomic Koch's Postulates'.

This transcription map has been correlated with the positions of the tRNA genes derived from the mtDNA sequence. It has been shown that, with the exception of the D loop and another small segment near the origin of replication, the mtDNA sequences are completely saturated by the rRNAs, poly(A)-containing RNAs and tRNAS coded for by the two strands. No evidence for intervening sequences has been found. The sequences coding for the individual poly(A)-containing RNA and rRNA species appear to be immediately contiguous on one side, and most frequently on both sides, to tRNA coding sequences. Furthermore, the H strand sequences coding for the two rRNAs, the poly(A)-containing RNAs and the tRNAs appear to be adjacent to each other, extending from coordinate 2100 to coordinate 95100 of the genome relative to the origin taken as 0100. The results are consistent with a model of transcription of the H strand in the form of a single molecule which is processed into mature RNA species by precise endonucleolytic cleavages, occurring in almost all cases immediately before and after a tRNA sequence.

Because the suppression hypothesis was refuted, the common practice of using antiarrhythmic drugs to suppress asymptomatic arrhythmias in patients after acute myocardial infarction has been curtailed. In CAST I, encainide and flecainide-treated patients had a 3.6-fold excessive risk of arrhythmic death compared with placebo-treated patients. The CAST results have been extrapolated to include other antiarrhythmic drugs, resulting in a concern of lethal proarrhythmia when using all antiarrhythmic drugs. Consequently, there have been substantial changes in the labeling of antiarrhythmic drugs and significant changes in the regulatory guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration.4 There has also been a dramatic restructuring of antiarrhythmic drug development by the pharmaceutical industry.

This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input. We show that this penalty term results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust features on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation that better captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data, corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold.

Methods Mongolian medicine with anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects is selected from Mongolian medicine prescription preparations. TCMSP, ETCM database and document mining methods were used to collect active compounds. Swiss TargetPrediction and SuperPred server were used to find targets of compounds with smiles number. Drugbank and Genecard database were used to collect antiviral drug targets. Then the above targets were compared and analyzed to screen out antiviral targets of Mongolia medicine. Metascape database platform was used to enrich and analyze the GO (Gene ontology) annotation and KEGG pathway of the targets. In view of the high homology of gene sequences between SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD domain and SARS virus, as well as their similarities in pathogenesis and clinical manifestations, we established SARS-CoV-2 S-protein model using Swiss-Model. The ZDOCK protein docking software was applied to dock the S-protein with the human angiotensin ACE2 protein to find out the key amino acids of the binding site. Taking ACE2 as the receptor, the molecular docking between the active ingredients and the target protein was studied by AutoDock molecular docking software. The interaction between ligand and receptor is applied to provide a choice for screening anti-COVID-19 drugs. Results A total of 253 active components were predicted. Metascape analysis showed that key candidate targets were significantly enriched in multiple pathways related to different toxins. These key candidate targets were mainly derived from phillyrin and chlorogenic acid. Through the protein docking between S-protein and ACE2, it is found that Glu329/Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2 play an important role in the binding process of the two. The results of molecular docking virtual calculation showed that phillyrin and chlorogenic acid could stably combine with Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2, respectively, which hindered the combination between S- protein and ACE2. Conclusion Phillyrin and chlorogenic acid can effectively prevent the combination of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and ACE2 at the molecular level.

The energy that we minimize treats the input images symmetrically, handles visibility properly, and imposes spatial smoothness while preserving discontinuities.

Objectives: this study assessed the relationships between quantitative influenza A virus replication and antigen detectability by the enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) Directigen\u00ae Flu A in different type of samples during experimental human infection. Study design: fourteen volunteers were inoculated with influenza A virus A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1). Four specimens types were collected in sequence for quantitative isolation in cell culture and antigen testing from days 1 to 8 after inoculation. Results: seventy-one (63%) of nasopharyngeal wash specimens were culture positive, compared to 51 (46%) of throat gargles, 51 (46%) of nasal swabs, and 27 (24%) of throat swabs. All subjects shed virus in their nasopharyngeal wash at least one day and 86% of subjects had a positive nasopharyngeal wash culture on day 2 after inoculation. The mean viral titers were highest on day 2 post inoculation for all specimen types and averaged 3.6 log10 TCID50/ml for nasal washes, 1.2 log10 TCID50/ml for throat gargles, 1.8 log10 TCID50/ml for the nasopharyngeal swabs, and 0.6 log10 TCID50/ml for the throat swabs. Mean viral titers in the nasal washes were significantly different (P<0.05) compared to other specimen types. The peak of sensitivity of EIA (compared to culture) was the second day after inoculation. Nasopharyngeal and throat swab results were combined for this analysis and considered positive by culture if positive in either or both samples. Thus, on day 2 the number of EIA positive samples relative to the number culture positive was 9/12 (75%) for nasopharyngeal wash specimens, 2/9 (22%) for throat gargles, and 7/11 (64%) for the combined throat and nasal swabs specimens. Conclusions: nasopharyngeal washes are the most sensitive sample type detecting influenza A virus in adults. For rapid diagnosis the Directigen\u00ae Flu A is a an alternative with a sensitivity compared to culture ranging between 64 and 78% if performed on nasopharyngeal specimens on day two or three after experimental infection in adults.

To illustrate the potential application of this reporter gene in virological studies a derivative of PVX.GFP was constructed in which the coat protein gene of PVX was replaced by GFP. Confocal laser scanning microscopy of the inoculated tissue showed that the virus was restricted to the inoculated cells thereby confirming earlier speculation that the PVX coat protein is essential for cell-to-cell movement.

The investigations covered concrete mixes at different water cementitious materials ratio, which contained low and high volumes of FA, and with or without the additional small amount of SF. 24 different mixes with 144 different samples were gathered form the literature for this purpose. These samples consist concretes that were cured for 3, 7, 28, 56 and 180 days. A NN model is constructed trained and tested using these data. The data used in the NN model are arranged in a format of eight input parameters that cover the fly ash replacement ratio (FA), silica fume replacement ratio (SF), total cementitious material (TCM), fine aggregate (ssa), coarse aggregate (ca), water content (W), high rate water reducing agent (HRWRA) and age of samples (AS) and an output parameter which is compressive strength of concrete (fc). A NN program was devised in MATLAB and the NN model was constructed in this program. The results showed that NNs have strong potential as a feasible tool for evaluation of the effect of cementitious material on the compressive strength of concrete.

The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of delta 2G(x,y)*I(x,y) for image I, where G(x,y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and delta 2 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround delta 2G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979).", "date": "1980", "authors": ["D.

Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS of all nodes in these networks. We review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity metric method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of the inherent RF communications capabilities of these devices.

Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, which is more robust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then dependent on the separation distance between two-adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points.

To offset the bias of the coupled model toward settling into an unrealistic state, the fluxes of heat and water at the ocean-atmosphere interface are adjusted by amounts that vary with season and geography but do not change from one year to the next. Starting from a quasi-equilibrium climate, three numerical time integrations of the coupled model are performed with gradually increasing, constant, and gradually decreasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

These interventions included promotion of breastfeeding; strategies to promote complementary feeding, with or without provision of food supplements; micronutrient interventions; general supportive strategies to improve family and community nutrition; and reduction of disease burden (promotion of handwashing and strategies to reduce the burden of malaria in pregnancy). We showed that although strategies for breastfeeding promotion have a large effect on survival, their effect on stunting is small. In populations with sufficient food, education about complementary feeding increased height-for-age Z score by 0.25 (95% CI 0.01-0.49), whereas provision of food supplements (with or without education) in populations with insufficient food increased the height-for-age Z score by 0.41 (0.05-0.76). Management of severe acute malnutrition according to WHO guidelines reduced the case-fatality rate by 55% (risk ratio 0.45, 0.32-0.62), and recent studies suggest that newer commodities, such as ready-to-use therapeutic foods, can be used to manage severe acute malnutrition in community settings. Effective micronutrient interventions for pregnant women included supplementation with iron folate (which increased haemoglobin at term by 12 g/L, 2.93-21.07) and micronutrients (which reduced the risk of low birthweight at term by 16% (relative risk 0.84, 0.74-0.95). Recommended micronutrient interventions for children included strategies for supplementation of vitamin A (in the neonatal period and late infancy), preventive zinc supplements, iron supplements for children in areas where malaria is not endemic, and universal promotion of iodised salt. We used a cohort model to assess the potential effect of these interventions on mothers and children in the 36 countries that have 90% of children with stunted linear growth. The model showed that existing interventions that were designed to improve nutrition and prevent related disease could reduce stunting at 36 months by 36%; mortality between birth and 36 months by about 25%; and disability-adjusted life-years associated with stunting, severe wasting, intrauterine growth restriction, and micronutrient deficiencies by about 25%.

Also the book contains the key mathematical background necessary for this purpose. Finally links with the analytical redundancy approach to fault detection in linear systems are established. We call abrupt change any change in the parameters of the system that occurs either instantaneously or at least very fast with respect to the sampling period of the measurements. Abrupt changes by no means refer to changes with large magnitude; on the contrary, in most applications the main problem is to detect small changes. Moreover, in some applications, the early warning of small - and not necessarily fast - changes is of crucial interest in order to avoid the economic or even catastrophic consequences that can result from an accumulation of such small changes. For example, small faults arising in the sensors of a navigation system can result, through the underlying integration, in serious errors in the estimated position of the plane.

The rate of deadenylation and the stability of the oligo(A) species varied between mRNAs, explaining the differences in mRNA half-lives. To examine how the transcript body was degraded following deadenylation, we used the strategy of inserting strong RNA secondary structures, which can slow exonucleolytic digestion and thereby trap decay intermediates, into the 3' UTR of mRNAs. Fragments lacking the 5' portion of two different mRNAs accumulated after deadenylation as full-length mRNA levels decreased.

Methods We prospectively investigated a cohort of 6336 patients undergoing general elective surgery at our institution to assess whether obesity affects the outcome of surgery. Exclusion criteria were emergency, vascular, thoracic, and bariatric operations; transplantation procedures; patients under immunosuppression; and operations done under local anaesthesia. Postoperative morbidity was analysed for non-obese and obese patients (body-mass index 2 vs 3=30 kg/m 2 ). Obesity was further stratified into mild obesity (30\u00b70\u201334\u00b79 kg/m 2 ) and severe obesity (\u2a7e35kg/m 2 ). Risk factors were analysed with univariate and multivariate models. Findings The cohort consisted of 6336 patients, of whom 808 (13%) were obese, 569 (9%) were mildly obese, and 239 (4%) had severe obesity. The morbidity rates in patients who were obese compared with those who were not were much the same (122 [15\u00b71%] of 808 vs 901 [16\u00b73%] of 5528; p=0\u00b726), with the exception of an increased incidence of wound infections after open surgery in patients who were obese (17 [4%] of 431 vs 92 [3%] of 3555, p=0\u00b703). Incidence of complications did not differ between patients who were mildly obese (91 [16\u00b70%] of 569), severely obese (36 [15\u00b71%] of 239), and non-obese (901 [16\u00b73%] of 5528; p=0\u00b719). In multivariate regression analyses, obesity was not a risk factor for development of postoperative complications.

The specificity of the forward primer in combination with different reverse ones was tested with genomic DNA from a variety of bacterial strains. Most actinomycetes investigated could be separated by TGGE and DGGE, with both techniques giving similar results. Two strategies were employed to study natural microbial communities. First, we used the selective amplification of actinomycete sequences (E. coli positions 226 to 528) for direct analysis of the products in denaturing gradients. Second, a nested PCR providing actinomycete-specific fragments (E. coli positions 226 to 1401) was used which served as template for a PCR when conserved primers were used. The products (E. coli positions 968 to 1401) of this indirect approach were then separated by use of gradient gels. Both approaches allowed detection of actinomycete communities in soil. The second strategy allowed the estimation of the relative abundance of actinomycetes within the bacterial community.

Emergence of a core-periphery pattern depends on transportation costs, economies of scale, and the share of manufacturing in national income. The study of economic geography-of the location of factors of production in space-occupies a relatively small part of standard economic analysis. International trade theory, in particular, conventionally treats nations as dimensionless points (and frequently assumes zero transportation costs between countries as well). Admittedly, models descended from von Thunen (1826) play an important role in urban studies, while Hotelling-type models of locational competition get a reasonable degree of attention in industrial organization.

The three filters are derived from the same theoretical basis in order to facilitate their comparison. Simulation results are used to compare the performance of the filters in the cases of linear plant dynamics and a non-linear output, non-linear plant dynamics and a linear output, and non-linear plant dynamics and non-linear output. We are able to conclude that the single stage iteration filter has superior mean squared error performance under all conditions, followed by the second-order filter.

The use of reverse genetics in preparing vaccine reference strains offers several advantages over the traditional method: (i) the reverse genetics approach is a direct rational approach compared with the potentially hit-or-miss traditional approach; (ii) reverse genetics will decontaminate a wild type virus that may have been derived in a non-validated system, e.g. a cell line not validated for vaccine purposes, or that may contain additional pathogens; (iii) at the plasmid stage, the HA can be engineered to remove pathogenic traits.

Early diagnosis is critical to a favourable outcome, but is difficult to achieve with current methods. Deep tissue diagnostic specimens are often difficult to obtain from critically ill patients. Newer antifungal agents exhibit differential mould activity, thus increasing the importance of establishing a specific diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. For these reasons, a range of alternate diagnostic strategies have been investigated. Most investigative efforts have focused on molecular and serological diagnostic techniques. The detection of metabolites produced by Aspergillus spp and a range of aspergillus-specific antibodies represent additional, but relatively underused, diagnostic avenues. The detection of galactomannan has been incorporated into diagnostic criteria for invasive aspergillosis, reflecting an increased understanding of the performance, utility, and limitations of this technique. Measurement of (1,3)-beta-D glucan in blood may be useful as a preliminary screening tool for invasive aspergillosis, despite the fact that this antigen can be detected in a number of other fungi. There have been extensive efforts directed toward the detection of Aspergillus spp DNA, but a lack of technical standardisation and relatively poor understanding of DNA release and kinetics continues to hamper the broad applicability of this technique.

Serotypes of the rhinoviruses account for 20 to 30 percent of episodes of the common cold. However, the specific causes of most upper respiratory infections are undefined. Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality for nonhospitalized adults despite the widespread use of effective antimicrobial agents. There are no accurate figures on the number of episodes of pneumonia that occur each year in ambulatory patients. In younger adults, the atypical pneumonia syndrome is the most common clinical presentation; Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most frequently identified causative agent. Other less common agents include Legionella pneumophila, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and Chlamydia. More than half a million adults are hospitalized each year with pneumonia. Persons older than 65 years of age have the highest rate of pneumonia admissions, 11.5 per 1,000 population. Pneumonia ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonias are changing. Forty years ago, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for the majority of infections. Today, a broad array of community-acquired pathogens have been implicated as etiologic agents including Legionella species, gram-negative bacilli, Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and nonbacterial pathogens.

The outbreak was centered in the Gulu district of northern Uganda, with secondary transmission to other districts. After the initial diagnosis of Sudan ebolavirus by the National Institute for Virology in Johannesburg, South Africa, a temporary diagnostic laboratory was established within the Gulu district at St. Mary's Lacor Hospital. The laboratory used antigen capture and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to diagnose Sudan ebolavirus infection in suspect patients. The RT-PCR and antigen-capture diagnostic assays proved very effective for detecting ebolavirus in patient serum, plasma, and whole blood. In samples collected very early in the course of infection, the RT-PCR assay could detect ebolavirus 24 to 48 h prior to detection by antigen capture. More than 1,000 blood samples were collected, with multiple samples obtained from many patients throughout the course of infection. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the viral load in multiple samples from patients with fatal and nonfatal cases, and these data were correlated with the disease outcome. RNA copy levels in patients who died averaged 2 log(10) higher than those in patients who survived. Using clinical material from multiple EHF patients, we sequenced the variable region of the glycoprotein. This Sudan ebolavirus strain was not derived from either the earlier Boniface (1976) or Maleo (1979) strain, but it shares a common ancestor with both.

Defining species on the basis of reproductive isolation (RI), on the other hand, is a concept best applied to the entire genome. The biological species concept (BSC; Mayr, 1963) stresses the isolation aspect of speciation on the basis of two fundamental genetic assumptions \u2010 the number of loci underlying species differentiation is large and the whole genome behaves as a cohesive, or coadapted genetic unit. Under these tenets, the exchange of any part of the genomes between diverging groups is thought to destroy their integrity. Hence, the maintenance of each species\u2019 genome cohesiveness by isolating mechanisms has become the central concept of species. In contrast, the Darwinian view of speciation is about differential adaptation to different natural or sexual environments. RI is viewed as an important by product of differential adaptation and complete RI across the whole genome need not be considered as the most central criterion of speciation. The emphasis on natural and sexual selection thus makes the Darwinian view compatible with the modern genic concept of evolution. Genetic and molecular analyses of speciation in the last decade have yielded surprisingly strong support for the neo-Darwinian view of extensive genetic differentiation and epistasis during speciation. However, the extent falls short of what BSC requires in order to achieve whole-genome \u2018cohesiveness\u2019. Empirical observations suggest that the gene is the unit of species differentiation. Significantly, the genetic architecture underlying RI, the patterns of species hybridization and the molecular signature of speciation genes all appear to support the view that RI is one of the manifestations of differential adaptation, as Darwin (1859, Chap. 8) suggested. The nature of this adaptation may be as much the result of sexual selection as natural selection. In the light of studies since its early days, BSC may now need a major revision by shifting the emphasis from isolation at the level of whole genome to differential adaptation at the genic level.

This multiple registration problem can be defined as a surface matching task. We treat it as least squares matching of overlapping surfaces. The surface may have been digitized/sampled point by point using a laser scanner device, a photogrammetric method or other surface measurement techniques. Our proposed method estimates the transformation parameters of one or more 3D search surfaces with respect to a 3D template surface, using the Generalized Gauss\u2013Markoff model, minimizing the sum of squares of the Euclidean distances between the surfaces. This formulation gives the opportunity of matching arbitrarily oriented 3D surface patches. It fully considers 3D geometry. Besides the mathematical model and execution aspects we address the further extensions of the basic model. We also show how this method can be used for curve matching in 3D space and matching of curves to surfaces. Some practical examples based on the registration of close-range laser scanner and photogrammetric point clouds are presented for the demonstration of the method.

We aimed to assess the role of Zika virus and dengue virus infection in developing Guillain-Barre syndrome. Methods In this case-control study, cases were patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome diagnosed at the Centre Hospitalier de Polynesie Francaise (Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia) during the outbreak period. Controls were age-matched, sex-matched, and residence-matched patients who presented at the hospital with a non-febrile illness (control group 1; n=98) and age-matched patients with acute Zika virus disease and no neurological symptoms (control group 2; n=70). Virological investigations included RT-PCR for Zika virus, and both microsphere immunofluorescent and seroneutralisation assays for Zika virus and dengue virus. Anti-glycolipid reactivity was studied in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome using both ELISA and combinatorial microarrays. Findings 42 patients were diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome during the study period. 41 (98%) patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome had anti-Zika virus IgM or IgG, and all (100%) had neutralising antibodies against Zika virus compared with 54 (56%) of 98 in control group 1 (p Interpretation This is the first study providing evidence for Zika virus infection causing Guillain-Barre syndrome.

Design: Cross-sectional surveys of outpatients aged 65 years or older. Setting: A Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VA) and a community managed care organization (MCO). Both organizations have organized influenza and pneumococcal vaccination programs. Subjects: VA subjects included all elderly respondents to a mailed survey of 500 randomly selected outpatients. MCO subjects included all respondents to a telephone survey of 300 randomly selected elderly members of the MCO. Measurements: The VA survey was conducted following the 1995\u20131996 influenza season while the MCO survey was conducted following the 1994\u20131995 season. Self-report from the mailed survey for VA subjects and from the telephone survey for MCO subjects was compared to medical record documentation (paper and computerized combined). Results: The response rate was 77% ( n = 369) for the VA subjects of whom 195 (53%) were aged 65 or older. The response rate for the MCO subjects was 84% ( n = 237). Self-report of influenza vaccination had a sensitivity (SENS) of 1.0 and a specificity (SPEC) of .79 with a kappa of .72 (95% CI .58\u2013.86) among VA patients. Among MCO patients, self-report of influenza vaccination had a SENS of .98 and a SPEC of .71 with kappa of .75 (95%CI .69\u2013.89). Self-report of pneumococcal vaccination status among VA patients had a SENS of .97 and a SPEC of .53 with a kappa of .42 (95%CI .32\u2013.52). Among MCO patients, self-report of pneumococcal vaccination had a SENS of .90 and a SPEC of .64 with a kappa of .54 (95%CI .40\u2013.68). A secondary analysis excluding subjects living outside of the VA's catchment area improved the specificity and indices of concordance of self-report of both influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. A secondary analysis of MCO data which excluded subjects who received a pneumococcal vaccination > 2 years prior to the study also improved concordance and the negative predictive value of self-report. Conclusions: Self-report of influenza vaccination is a highly sensitive and moderately specific measure. Self-report of pneumococcal vaccination is also a highly sensitive but less specific measure of vaccination status. Lower rates of validity for pneumococcal vaccination may reflect both less accurate recall, particularly for more distant vaccination, and less complete documentation in medical records.", "date": "1999", "authors": ["Roderick Mac Donald 1, 2, Leslie Baken 1, 2, Andrew Nelson 1, 2, Kristin L.

We have examined the responses of simple cells in the cat's atriate cortex to visual patterns that were designed to reveal the extent to which these cells may be considered to sum light-evoked influences linearly across their receptive fields. We used one-dimensional luminance-modulated bars and grating as stimuli; their orientation was always the same as the preferred orientation of the neurone under study. The stimuli were presented on an oscilloscope screen by a digital computer, which also accumulated neuronal responses and controlled a randomized sequence of stimulus presentations. 2. The majority of simple cells respond to sinusoidal gratings that are moving or whose contrast is modulated in time in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that they have linear spatial summation. Their responses to moving gratings of all spatial frequencies are modulated in synchrony with the passage of the gratings' bars across their receptive fields, and they do not produce unmodulated responses even at the highest spatial frequencies. Many of these cells respond to temporally modulated stationary gratings simply by changing their response amplitude sinusoidally as the spatial phase of the grating the grating is varied. Nonetheless, their behavior appears to indicate linear spatial summation, since we show in an Appendix that the absence of a 'null' phase in a visual neurone need not indicate non-linear spatial summation, and further that a linear neurone lacking a 'null' phase should give responses of the form that we have observed in this type of simple cell. 3. A minority of simple cells appears to have significant non-linearities of spatial summation. These neurones respond to moving gratings of high spatial frequency with a partially or totally unmodulated elevation of firing rate. They have no 'null' phases when tested with stationary gratings, and reveal their non-linearity by giving responses to gratings of some spatial phases that are composed partly or wholly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency ('on-off' responses). 4. We compared simple receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the most sensitive subregions of simple cells' receptive fields are roughly the same width as the individual bars of the gratings to which they are most sensitive.

Upon activation of this operon, a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) is synthesized that supports bacterial cell-to-cell contacts and triggers the production of thick, multilayered biofilms. Thus, the ica gene cluster represents a genetic determinant that significantly contributes to the virulence of specific Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. PIA synthesis has been reported recently to undergo a phase variation process. In this study, biofilm-forming Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and their PIA-negative phase variants were analysed genetically to investigate the molecular mechanisms of phase variation. We have characterized biofilm-negative variants by Southern hybridization with ica-specific probes, polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing. The data obtained in these analyses suggested that in approximately 30% of the variants the missing biofilm formation was due to the inactivation of either the icaA or the icaC gene by the insertion of the insertion sequence element IS256. Furthermore, it was shown that the transposition of IS256 into the ica operon is a reversible process. After repeated passages of the PIA-negative insertional mutants, the biofilm-forming phenotype could be restored. Nucleotide sequence analyses of the revertants confirmed the complete excision of IS256, including the initially duplicated 8 bp target sites.

Removal of all forcing except greenhouse gases from the \u223c1000-year time series results in a residual with a very large late-20th-century warming that closely agrees with the response predicted from greenhouse gas forcing.

A quantitative assay for viral RNA in plasma or sera that differs in several aspects from those reported previously was developed. First, whereas conventional reverse transcriptase-PCR assays involve a two-step process and use two enzymes, the method described uses a single enzyme, rTth DNA polymerase, for both reverse transcription and PCR. The reactions are carried out in a single tube and with a single buffer solution with uninterrupted thermal cycling. Second, uracil-N-glycosylase and dUTP are incorporated into the reaction mixtures to ensure that any carryover of DNA from previous amplifications will not compromise quantitation. Third, a quantitation standard is incorporated into each reaction mixture so that differences in amplification efficiency caused by sample interferents, variability in reaction conditions, or thermal cycling can be normalized. To ensure comparable amplification efficiency, the quantitation standard has the same primer-binding regions as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 target and generates an amplified product of the same size and base composition. The probe-binding region was replaced with a sequence that can be detected separately. Fourth, a colorimetric detection format was modified to provide at least a four-log-unit dynamic range.

In addition, mechanisms are discussed by which DIPs interfere with the replication of their helper virus leading to the production of mainly progeny DIPs by coinfected cells. Even though DIPs cannot replicate on their own, they are biologically active and it is well known that they have a huge impact on virus replication, evolution, and pathogenesis. Moreover, defective genomes are potent inducers of the innate immune response. Yet, little attention has been paid to DIPs in recent years and their impact on biotechnological products such as vaccines and viral vectors remains elusive in most cases.

Given a wild type sequence that is less than optimal, I derive the fitness rank of the next allele typically fixed by natural selection as well as the mean and variance of the jump in fitness that results when natural selection drives a substitution. Looking over the whole series of substitutions required to reach the best allele, I show that the mean fitness jumps occurring throughout an adaptive walk are constrained to a twofold window of values, assuming only that adaptation begins from a reasonably fit allele. I also show that the first substitution and the substitution of largest effect account for a large share of the total fitness increase during adaptation. I further show that the distribution of selection coefficients fixed throughout such an adaptive walk is exponential (ignoring mutations of small effect), a finding reminiscent of that seen in Fisher's geometric model of adaptation.

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category.

While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.", "date": "2010", "authors": ["Alain F. Zuur 1, Elena N. Ieno 1, Chris S.

Using double digests, these fragments could be ordered into a physical map of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites around the \u03b2-globin gene in the rabbit genome.

A convenient normal form is shown to exist. Analysis of the formalism's expressiveness suggests that it is particularly well suited to modeling ordering shifts between languages, balancing needed flexibility against complexity constraints.

The RON nodes monitor the functioning and quality of the Internet paths among themselves, and use this information to decide whether to route packets directly over the Internet or by way of other RON nodes, optimizing application-specific routing metrics.Results from two sets of measurements of a working RON deployed at sites scattered across the Internet demonstrate the benefits of our architecture. For instance, over a 64-hour sampling period in March 2001 across a twelve-node RON, there were 32 significant outages, each lasting over thirty minutes, over the 132 measured paths. RON's routing mechanism was able to detect, recover, and route around all of them, in less than twenty seconds on average, showing that its methods for fault detection and recovery work well at discovering alternate paths in the Internet. Furthermore, RON was able to improve the loss rate, latency, or throughput perceived by data transfers; for example, about 5% of the transfers doubled their TCP throughput and 5% of our transfers saw their loss probability reduced by 0.05.

Metabolic instability is a property of many regulatory proteins. A short in vivo half-life* of a regulator provides a way to generate its spatial gradients and allows for rapid adjustments of its concentration (or subunit composition) through changes in the rate of its synthesis. A protein can also be conditionally unstable: long-lived or short-lived depending on the state of a cell. Conditionally short-lived regulators are often deployed as components of control circuits. One example is cyclins\u2014a family of related proteins whose destruction at specific stages of the cell cycle regulates cell division and growth (Chapter 12; Murray and Hunt, 1993). In addition, many proteins are long-lived as components of larger complexes such as ribosomes and oligomeric proteins but are metabolically unstable as free subunits.

Advances in molecular and computational biology have led to the development of powerful, high-thoughput methods for the analysis of differential gene expression. These tools have opened up new opportunities in disciplines ranging from cell and developmental biology to drug development and pharmacogenomics. In this review, the attributes of five commonly used differential gene expression methods are discussed: expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing, cDNA microarray hybridization, subtractive cloning, differential display, and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). The application of EST sequencing and microarray hybridization is illustrated by the discovery of novel genes associated with osteoblast differentiation. The application of subtractive cloning is presented as a tool to identify genes regulated in vivo by the transcription factor pax-6. These and other examples illustrate the power of genomics for discovering novel genes that are important in biology and which also represent new targets for drug development. The central theme of the review is that each of the approaches to identifying differentially expressed genes is useful, and that the experimental context and subsequent evaluation of differentially expressed genes are the critical features that determine success.

These features may be attributable to the following facts: (a) COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to be highly expressed in GI epithelial cells, providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has been found in stool specimens of infected patients, and 20% of patients showed prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faecal samples after the virus converting to negative in the respiratory system.

Chases in which male flies (Fannia canicularis) pursue other flies were studied by filming such encounters from directly below. Males will start to chase whenever a second fly comes within 10\u201315 cm (Fig. 3). 2. Throughout these chases there was a continuous relationship between the angle (\u03b8e) made by the leading fly and the direction of flight of the chasing fly, and the angular velocity of the chasing fly (\u03c9f). This relation was approximately linear, with a slope of 20 \u00b0 s\u22121 per degree \u03b8e (Figs. 4\u20137). 3. The maximum correlation between \u03c9f and \u03b8ite occurs after a lag of approximately 30 ms, which represents the total delay in the system (Fig. 8). 4. In the region close to the chasing fly's axis (\u03b8ite less than about 35 \u00b0) a second mechanism exists in which the angular velocity of the chasing fly (\u03c9f) is controlled by the relative angular velocity of the leading fly (\u03c9e), rather than its relative position. The ratio of \u03c9f to \u03c9e in this region is approximately 0.7. 5. Using the results in 2\u20134 above, and an empirically determined relation between the angular and forward velocities of the chasing fly, it was possible to simulate the flight path of the chasing fly, given that of the leading fly (Fig. 11). Because these simulations predict correctly the manoeuvres and outcomes of quite complicated chases, it is concluded that the control system actually used by the fly is accurately described by conclusions 2\u20134. 6.

The characteristic common to these methods is that their ability to generalize from a single example follows from their ability to explain why the training example is a member of the concept being learned. This paper proposes a general, domain-independent mechanism, called EBG, that unifies previous approaches to explanation-based generalization.

Whittaker defined beta diversity as the variation in species com- position among sites in a geographic area. Beta diversity is a key concept for understanding the functioning of ecosystems, for the conservation of biodiversity, and for ecosystem management. This paper explains how hypotheses about the origin of beta diversity can be tested by partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data (presence- absence or abundance data) with respect to environmental variables and spatial base func- tions. We compare two statistical methods to accomplish that. The sum-of-squares of a community composition data table, which is one possible measure of beta diversity, is correctly partitioned by canonical ordination; hence, canonical partitioning produces correct estimates of the different portions of community composition variation. In recent years, several authors interested in the variation in community composition among sites (beta diversity) have used another method, variation partitioning on distance matrices (Mantel approach). Their results led us to compare the two partitioning approaches, using simulated data generated under hypotheses about the variation of community composition among sites. The theoretical developments and simulation results led to the following observations: (1) the variance of a community composition table is a measure of beta diversity. (2) The variance of a dissimilarity matrix among sites is not the variance of the community com- position table nor a measure of beta diversity; hence, partitioning on distance matrices should not be used to study the variation in community composition among sites. (3) In all of our simulations, partitioning on distance matrices underestimated the amount of variation in community composition explained by the raw-data approach, and (4) the tests of significance had less power than the tests of canonical ordination. Hence, the proper statistical procedure for partitioning the spatial variation of community composition data among environmental and spatial components, and for testing hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of variation in community composition among sites, is canonical parti- tioning. The Mantel approach is appropriate for testing other hypotheses, such as the var- iation in beta diversity among groups of sites. Regression on distance matrices is also appropriate for fitting models to similarity decay plots.", "date": "2005", "authors": ["Pierre Legendre , Daniel Borcard , Pedro R.

From insects to humans, Charles Gallistel explores the sophisticated computations performed in these ubiquitous yet neglected domains of animal learning. He proposes new and imaginative hypotheses about brain and mental processes and provides original insights about animal behavior using a computational-representational framework that is an exciting alternative to traditional associative theories of learning.Gallistel argues compellingly that experimental psychologists should begin to view the phenomena of learning within a framework that utilizes as the proper unit of analysis the computation and storage of a quantity, rather than the formation of an association that has been the basis of traditional learning theory. His approach reveals the formal structure of the environmental relationships that animals master to time and orient their behavior. It clarifies what representations different animals can and cannot compute and the nature of the computations by which animals derive these representations.The author backs up this thesis with studies that encompass a vast range of animal learning: animal navigation (the use of dead reckoning and cognitive maps); the mechanisms of timekeeping in the nervous system; the registration and utilization of time of occurrence (circadian phase) in learned behavior; the learning and use of temporal intervals and of numerosity; the computation of rates of occurrence; modern findings and theories of classical conditioning. Gallistel surveys the experimental literature in zoology, biology, neuroscience, and psychology that bears on those aspects of their environment that animals represent and the computations they perform in constructing and utilizing those representations. He reveals the fundamental role these representations play in learning and memory, and the implications of these findings in the search for the cellular basis of memory.Charles R.

The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large-scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks. Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000-2020 will be 270 megatonnes (Mt) carbon (or 36 g carbon m(-2) yr(-1) on average over 374,000 km2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to approximately 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959-1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change.

However, the exact pattern of this relation continues to be debated. This paper discusses whether or not appreciable additional gain can be achieved with very early treatment. Methods The relation between treatment delay and short-term mortality (up to 35 days) was evaluated using tabulated data from all randomised trials of at least 100 patients (n=22; 50\u2008246 patients) that compared fibrinolytic therapy with placebo or control, reported between 1983 and 1993. Findings Benefit of fibrinolytic therapy was 65 (SD 14), 37 (9), 26 (6) and 29 (5) lives saved per 1000 treated patients in the 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-6 h intervals, respectively. Proportional mortality reduction was significantly higher in patients treated within 2 h compared to those treated later (44% [95% CI 32, 53] vs 20% [15, 25]; p=0\u00b7001). The relation between treatment delay and mortality reduction per 1000 treated patients was expressed significantly better by a non-linear (19-4-0-6x+29-3x \u22121 ) than a linear (34 7-1\u00b76x) regression equation (p=0\u00b703).

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation9s design are considered, (i) the representation9s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape9s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image.

Ideally, dominant, gain-of-function human diseases could be treated using siRNAs that specifically silence the mutant disease allele, while leaving expression of the wild-type allele unperturbed. Previous reports suggest that siRNAs can be designed with single nucleotide specificity, but no rational basis for the design of siRNAs with single nucleotide discrimination has been proposed. We systematically identified siRNAs that discriminate between the wild-type and mutant alleles of two disease genes: the human Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene, which contributes to the progression of hereditary amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through the gain of a toxic property, and the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which causes Huntington disease when its CAG-repeat region expands beyond approximately 35 repeats. Using cell-free RNAi reactions in Drosophila embryo lysate and reporter assays and microarray analysis of off-target effects in cultured human cells, we identified positions within an siRNA that are most sensitive to mismatches. We also show that purine:purine mismatches imbue an siRNA with greater discriminatory power than other types of base mismatches. siRNAs in which either a G:U wobble or a mismatch is located in the \u201cseed\u201d sequence, the specialized siRNA guide region responsible for target binding, displayed lower levels of selectivity than those in which the mismatch was located 3\u2032 to the seed; this region of an siRNA is critical for target cleavage but not siRNA binding.

In potato virus X (PVX)/potyviral synergism, increased pathogenicity and accumulation of PVX are mediated by the expression of potyviral 5' proximal sequences encoding P1, the helper component proteinase (HC-Pro), and a fraction of P3. Here, we report that the same potyviral sequence (termed P1/HC-Pro) enhances the pathogenicity and accumulation of two other heterologous viruses: cucumber mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus. In the case of PVX-potyviral synergism, we show that the expression of the HC-Pro gene product, but not the RNA sequence itself, is sufficient to induce the increase in PVX pathogenicity and that both P1 and P3 coding sequences are dispensable for this aspect of the synergistic interaction. In protoplasts, expression of the potyviral P1/HC-Pro region prolongs the accumulation of PVX (-) strand RNA and transactivates expression of a reporter gene from a PVX subgenomic promoter. Unlike the synergistic enhancement of PVX pathogenicity, which requires only expression of HC-Pro, the enhancement of PVX (-) strand RNA accumulation in protoplasts is significantly greater when the entire P1/HC-Pro sequence is expressed.

While providing a cure in select cases, doxorubicin causes toxicity to most major organs, especially life-threatening cardiotoxicity, which forces the treatment to become dose-limiting. Key findings\u2002 Doxorubicin is known to bind to DNA-associated enzymes, intercalate with DNA base pairs, and target multiple molecular targets to produce a range of cytotoxic effects. For instance, it causes the activation of various molecular signals from AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase inducing apoptosis) to influence the Bcl-2/Bax apoptosis pathway. By altering the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, downstream activation of different caspases can occur resulting in apoptosis. Doxorubicin also induces apoptosis and necrosis in healthy tissue causing toxicity in the brain, liver, kidney and heart. Over the years, many studies have been conducted to devise a drug delivery system that would eliminate these adverse affects including liposomes, hydrogel and nanoparticulate systems, and we highlight the pros and cons of these drug delivery systems. Summary\u2002 Overall the future for the continued use of doxorubicin clinically against cancer looks set to be prolonged, provided certain enhancements as listed above are made to its chemistry, delivery and toxicity.

In the present study, we have investigated the effect of particle size on the pathway of entry and subsequent intracellular fate in non-phagocytic B16 cells, using a range of fluorescent latex beads of defined sizes (50-1000 nm). Our data reveal that particles as large as 500 nm were internalized by cells via an energy-dependent process. With an increase in size (50-500 nm), cholesterol depletion increased the efficiency of inhibition of uptake. The processing of the smaller particles was significantly perturbed upon microtubule disruption, while displaying a negligible effect on that of the 500 nm beads. Inhibitor and co-localization studies revealed that the mechanism by which the beads were internalized, and their subsequent intracellular routing, was strongly dependent on particle size. Internalization of microspheres with a diameter <200 nm involved clathrin-coated pits. With increasing size, a shift to a mechanism that relied on caveolae-mediated internalization became apparent, which became the predominant pathway of entry for particles of 500 nm in size. At these conditions, delivery to the lysosomes was no longer apparent. The data indicate that the size itself of (ligand-devoid) particles can determine the pathway of entry.

Currently, classification of NoV strains beneath the species level has been based on sequences from different regions of the viral genome. As a result, the phylogenetic insights of some virus were not appropriately interpreted, and no consensus has been reached to establish a uniform classification scheme. To provide a consistent and reliable scientific basis for classifying NoVs, we analyzed the amino acid sequences for the major capsid protein of 164 NoV strains by first using an alignment based on the predicted 3D structures. A Bayesian tree was generated, and the maximum likelihood pairwise distances of the aligned sequences were used to evaluate the results from the uncorrected pairwise distance method. Analyses of the pairwise distances demonstrated three clearly resolved peaks, suggesting that NoV strains beneath the species level can be classified at three levels: strain (S), cluster (C), and genogroup (G). The uncorrected pairwise distance ranges for S, C, and G were 0\u201314.1%, 14.3\u201343.8%, and 44.9\u201361.4%, respectively. A scheme with 29 genetic clusters [8 in genogroup 1 (G1), 17 in G2, 2 in G3, and 1 each in G4 and G5] was defined on the basis of the tree topology with the standards provided and was supported by the distance analysis.

The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification.

The total length of the genome finally confirmed was 3,573,470 bp, including the previously reported sequence of 1,003,450 bp from map position 64% to 92% of the genome. The entire sequence was assembled from the sequences of the physical map-based contigs of cosmid clones and of lambda clones and long PCR products which were used for gap-filling. The accuracy of the sequence was guaranteed by analysis of both strands of DNA through the entire genome. The authenticity of the assembled sequence was supported by restriction analysis of long PCR products, which were directly amplified from the genomic DNA using the assembled sequence data. To predict the potential protein-coding regions, analysis of open reading frames (ORFs), analysis by the GeneMark program and similarity search to databases were performed. As a result, a total of 3,168 potential protein genes were assigned on the genome, in which 145 (4.6%) were identical to reported genes and 1,257 (39.6%) and 340 (10.8%) showed similarity to reported and hypothetical genes, respectively. The remaining 1,426 (45.0%) had no apparent similarity to any genes in databases. Among the potential protein genes assigned, 128 were related to the genes participating in photosynthetic reactions. The sum of the sequences coding for potential protein genes occupies 87% of the genome length. By adding rRNA and tRNA genes, therefore, the genome has a very compact arrangement of protein- and RNA-coding regions. A notable feature on the gene organization of the genome was that 99 ORFs, which showed similarity to transposase genes and could be classified into 6 groups, were found spread all over the genome, and at least 26 of them appeared to remain intact.

Partially recycled, acid-free paper using soy-based ink. If the earth's inhabitants were to live at the standard of the U.S., we would require three planet Earths to support us. Many of us have heard or read something like this before. Our Ecological Footprint provides a graphically compelling and quantitatively rigorous way for us to engage in the worldwide sustainability debate: Ecological Footprint analysis. Through this analysis we can determine the consequences of our behavior, and proposed solutions, at any level: individual, household, community, nation, or world. Ecological Footprint analysis measures the aggregate land area required for a given population to exist in a sustainable manner. Wackernagel and Rees note that at 11 acres per person, the U.S. has the highest per capita footprint and suggest that this number should be closer to 6 acres per person. Further, the U.S. faces an 80% ecological deficit, which means we are borrowing from our grandchildren's legacy, and expropriating land from elsewhere in the world. By contrast, each European requires around 5 acres; however, Europeans face higher ecological deficits because they have smaller land areas. Unlike other approaches, which focus on the depletion of non-renewables such as fossil fuel and minerals, Ecological Footprint analysis asserts that the road to sustainability must be paved with sustainable practices. Thus, our use of fossil fuel must have as a compensatory sink the acres of woodlot required to sequester the carbon from our combustion of fossil fuel (in our cars, home heating, etc.) or, alternatively, the acres of fields required to grow biofuel. For example, in comparing our daily commute by car, bus or bicycle, and considering all land requirements (e.g., manufacturing land to produce", "date": "1995", "authors": ["Gene Bazan"], "related_topics": ["Land footprint", "Ecological footprint", "Biocapacity"], "citation_count": "5,142", "reference_count": "0", "references": ["2983557247", "2050104595", "2102620549", "1496684753", "2102644839", "2146904764", "2080314777", "2610343300", "2007080465", "2074036952"]}, {"id": "2151554678", "title": "No free lunch theorems for optimization", "abstract": "A framework is developed to explore the connection between effective optimization algorithms and the problems they are solving.

METHODS: A total of 12,799 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), and fibromyalgia (FM) completed a mailed survey regarding the location and intensity of their pain in 38 articular and nonarticular regions. The data were analyzed using item response theory (IRT) by nonparametric Mokken analysis followed by Rasch analysis. The resultant scale was examined for its association with clinical severity variables and its ability to distinguish patients diagnosed with and without FM. RESULTS: The resultant 19 item regional pain scale (RPS) was composed primarily of nonarticular regions. The scale had strong scalability as measured by the Mokken H statistic (H = 0.52), and satisfied the Mokken monotonicity and double monotonicity criteria. The RPS also fit the Rasch model and had satisfactory reliability and separation statistics. Of all clinical variables assessed by survey, the RPS best identified patients diagnosed with FM. In addition, the scale correlated with measures of clinical severity, regardless of diagnosis, and predicted measures of utilization. CONCLUSION: The RPS is a valid scale of pain extent. It can be useful to identify patients with FM or can be used to develop a new definition of FM, even among patients with concomitant illnesses such as RA and OA. In addition, it is a measure of pain extent that is disease independent, and works as well in RA and OA as in FM to identify patients with increased severity and resource utilization.", "date": "2003", "authors": ["Frederick Wolfe"], "related_topics": ["Pain scale", "Rasch model", "Fibromyalgia", "Severity of illness", "Item response theory", "Osteoarthritis", "Comorbidity", "Predictive value of tests", "Physical therapy", "Medicine"], "citation_count": "204", "reference_count": "76", "references": ["2037377025", "1594031697", "1995617856", "2253364553", "2089763487", "2274722622", "2041481324", "1985004174", "2604008658", "2006444775"]}, {"id": "2102424972", "title": "Evolutionary trees from DNA sequences: A maximum likelihood approach", "abstract": "The application of maximum likelihood techniques to the estimation of evolutionary trees from nucleic acid sequence data is discussed.

When it is tested for periodic signals and for signals with additive noise or jitter, it proves to be several orders of magnitude more accurate than the methods commonly used for speech analysis. This makes our method capable of measuring harmonics-to-noise ratios in the lag domain with an accuracy and reliability much greater than that of any of the usual frequency-domain methods. By definition, the best candidate for the acoustic pitch period of a sound can be found from the position of the maximum of the autocorrelation function of the sound, while the degree of periodicity (the harmonics-to-noise ratio) of the sound can be found from the relative height of this maximum. However, sampling and windowing cause problems in accurately determining the position and height of the maximum. These problems have led to inaccurate timedomain and cepstral methods for pitch detection, and to the exclusive use of frequency-domain methods for the determination of the harmonics-to-noise ratio. In this paper, I will tackle these problems. Table 1 shows the specifications of the resulting algorithm for two spectrally maximally different kinds of periodic sounds: a sine wave and a periodic pulse train; other periodic sounds give results between these.

We compared the efficacy of three acellular vaccines with a UK whole-cell vaccine. Methods We enrolled 82892 babies aged 2\u20133 months. Babies were vaccinated at age 3 months, 5 months, and 12 months, or age 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. They were randomly assigned a two-component acellular diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine (n=20697), a three-component acellular DTP vaccine (n=20728), a five-component acellular DTP vaccine (n=20747), or a UK whole-cell DTP vaccine (n=20720). We collected data for all reported cases of culture-confirmed pertussis during 3 years of follow-up. The treatment status of the two-component-vaccine group had to be made known midway through the trial for boosting because of poor efficacy. We included data for the two-component vaccine in the analysis of safety and immunogenicity, and data up its unmasking in secondary analyses of relative efficacy. Analyses were by intention to treat. Findings During follow-up from the third dose (mean 22 months), in the 3 months, 5 months, 12 months schedule, there were 15 cases of culture-confirmed pertussis with at least 21 days of paroxysmal cough in the whole-cell group, relative risk 1\u00b700, compared with 13 in the five-component group (0\u00b785 [95% Cl 0\u00b741\u20131\u00b779]), and 21 in the three-component group (1\u00b738 [0\u00b771\u20132\u00b769]). For culture-confirmed pertussis, with or without cough, there were 19 cases in the whole-cell group (1\u00b700), 27 in the five-component group (1\u00b740 [0\u00b778\u20132\u00b752]), and 49 in the three-component group (2\u00b755 [1\u00b750\u20134\u00b733]). In the intention-to-treat analyses, from the first dose in the 3 months, 5 months, 12 months schedule the whole-cell vaccine was significantly more protective than the three-component vaccine against typical pertussis. Between the second and the third doses, culture-confirmed pertussis with any cough and with at least 21 days of paroxysmal cough was significantly more frequent in the two-component group than in the three-component group, and in the three-component group than in the five-component and the whole-cell groups, respectively. The serological response of the acellular vaccines in the 2 months, 4 months, 6 months schedule were similar to those previously reported. The whole-cell vaccine was highly immunogenic for fimbriae, pertactin, and filamentous haemagglutinin, but had a low antipertussis toxin response. Hypotonic hyporesponsiveness occurred significantly more frequently in the whole-cell group (p Interpretations The efficacy of the UK whole-cell vaccine and the five-component and three-component vaccines was similar against culture-confirmed pertussis with at least 21 days of paroxysmal cough.

Methods We randomly assigned patients with septic shock who were undergoing mechanical ventilation to receive hydrocortisone (at a dose of 200 mg per day) or placebo for 7 days or until death or discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU), whichever came first. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 90 days. Results From March 2013 through April 2017, a total of 3800 patients underwent randomization. Status with respect to the primary outcome was ascertained in 3658 patients (1832 of whom had been assigned to the hydrocortisone group and 1826 to the placebo group). At 90 days, 511 patients (27.9%) in the hydrocortisone group and 526 (28.8%) in the placebo group had died (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.10; P=0.50).

This study has examined the capacity of AIDS PBM to lyse tumor target cells as well as their ability to secrete TNF. Untreated PBM from AIDS patients were significantly cytotoxic to U937 target cells and responded to IFN-gamma pretreatment with augmented cytotoxicity. Both the spontaneous and IFN-gamma-stimulated cytotoxic activity was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than that observed with normal PBM. The cytotoxic activity depended on the E:T ratio used and was higher in AIDS PBM at all ratios tested (10:1 to 40:1). Because TNF has been implicated in macrophage cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we examined whether the elevated cytotoxic activity of AIDS PBM was associated with an increase in TNF production. Supernatants from PBM cultured overnight with or without IFN-gamma were tested in a bioassay measuring cytotoxicity against U937 target cells as well as in an RIA specific for TNF. Supernatants derived from either unstimulated or IFN-gamma-treated AIDS PBM exhibited significantly higher levels of cytotoxicity than supernatants from normal macrophages. Both normal and AIDS PBM produced higher levels of cytotoxic factors in response to IFN-gamma. As determined by the RIA, AIDS PBM spontaneously released high levels of TNF whereas little TNF was produced by normal PBM. Treatment with IFN-gamma augmented the level of TNF production in both AIDS and normal PBM. These results demonstrate that PBM from AIDS patients have undergone in vivo activation as manifested by both cytotoxicity against tumor target cells and production of TNF. Target cell lysis by both AIDS PBM and their supernatants was inhibited by monoclonal anti-rTNF, suggesting that the increase in PBM cell-mediated cytotoxicity was caused by an increase in TNF production.

As a first step to investigating the relationship between LD and recombination, we have analyzed a 216-kb segment of the class II region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) already characterized for familial crossovers. High-resolution LD analysis shows the existence of extended domains of strong association interrupted by patchwork areas of LD breakdown. Sperm typing shows that these areas correspond precisely to meiotic crossover hot spots. All six hot spots defined share a remarkably similar symmetrical morphology but vary considerably in intensity, and are not obviously associated with any primary DNA sequence determinants of hot-spot activity. These hot spots occur in clusters and together account for almost all crossovers in this region of the MHC.

Amino acid sites in a protein are expected to be under different selective pressures and have different underlying omega ratios. We develop models that account for heterogeneous omega ratios among amino acid sites and apply them to phylogenetic analyses of protein-coding DNA sequences. These models are useful for testing for adaptive molecular evolution and identifying amino acid sites under diversifying selection. Ten data sets of genes from nuclear, mitochondrial, and viral genomes are analyzed to estimate the distributions of omega among sites. In all data sets analyzed, the selective pressure indicated by the omega ratio is found to be highly heterogeneous among sites. Previously unsuspected Darwinian selection is detected in several genes in which the average omega ratio across sites is 1. Genes undergoing positive selection include the beta-globin gene from vertebrates, mitochondrial protein-coding genes from hominoids, the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from human influenza virus A, and HIV-1 env, vif, and pol genes.

Since most economic data appearing at intervals of less than a year are to a greater or lesser extent \"manufactured\" from more basic time series, the problem of assessing the effects of the \"manufacturing\" processes upon the essential characteristics of the raw material to which they are applied is not unimportant. Perhaps the most common type of adjustment applied to raw economic time series is that designed to eliminate so-called seasonal fluctuations. The precise nature of seasonality is not easy to define, but an attempt is made in Section 2.1 below. The techniques employed to study the effects of seasonal adjustment procedures are those of spectral and cross-spectral analysis. In somewhat oversimplified terms the basic idea behind these types of analysis is that a stochastic time series may be decomposed into an infinite number of sine and cosine waves with infinitesimal random amplitudes. Spectral analysis deals with a single time series in terms of its frequency \"content\"; cross-spectral analysis deals with the relation between two time series in terms of their respective frequency \"contents.\" The two techniques are discussed in both theoretical and practical terms. Spectral analyses have been made for about seventy-five time series of United States employment, unemployment, labor force, and various categories thereof. Cross-spectral analyses have been made of the relations between these series and the corresponding series as seasonally adjusted by the procedures used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Two major conclusions regarding the effects of the BLS seasonal adjustment procedures emerge from these analyses. First, these procedures remove far more from the series to which they are applied than can properly be considered as seasonal. Second, if the relation between two seasonally adjusted series in time is compared with the corresponding relation between the original series in time, it is found that there is a distortion due to the process of seasonal adjustment itself. Both defects impair the usefulness of the seasonally adjusted series as indicators of economic conditions, but, of the two, temporal distortion is the more serious defect.

It involves creating a hybrid model of the entire structure by combining an experimental test piece\u2014the substructure\u2014with a numerical model describing the remainder of the system. The technique is useful when it is impractical to experimentally test the entire structure or complete numerical modelling is insufficient. In this paper, we focus on the influence of delay in the system, which is generally due to the inherent dynamics of the transfer systems (actuators) used for structural testing. This naturally gives rise to a delay differential equation (DDE) model of the substructured system. With the case of a substructured system consisting of a single mass\u2013spring oscillator we demonstrate how a DDE model can be used to understand the influence of the response delay of the actuator. Specifically, we describe a number of methods for identifying the critical time delay above which the system becomes unstable. Because of the low damping in many large structures a typical situation is that a substructuring test would operate in an unstable region if additional techniques were not implemented in practice. We demonstrate with an adaptive delay compensation technique that the substructured mass\u2013spring oscillator system can be stabilized successfully in an experiment. The approach of DDE modelling also allows us to determine the dependence of the critical delay on the parameters of the delay compensation scheme. Using this approach we develop an over-compensation scheme that will help ensure stable experimental testing from initiation to steady state operation. This technique is particularly suited to stiff structures or those with very low natural damping as regularly encountered in structural engineering.

In this study, we used filipin, a sterol-binding agent that disrupts caveolae and caveolae-like structures, to explore their role in the internalization and activation of CT in CaCo-2 human intestinal epithelial cells. When toxin internalization was quantified, only 33% of surface-bound toxin was internalized by filipin-treated cells within 1 h compared with 79% in untreated cells. However, CT activation as determined by its reduction to form the A1 peptide and CT activity as measured by cyclic AMP accumulation were inhibited in filipin-treated cells. Another sterol-binding agent, 2-hydroxy-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, gave comparable results. The cationic amphiphilic drug chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent, receptor-mediated endocytosis, however, affected neither CT internalization, activation, nor activity in contrast to its inhibitory effects on diphtheria toxin cytotoxicity. As filipin did not inhibit the latter, the two drugs appeared to distinguish between caveolae- and coated pit\u2013mediated processes. In addition to its effects in CaCo-2 cells that express low levels of caveolin, filipin also inhibited CT activity in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 and Jurkat T lymphoma cells that are, respectively, rich in or lack caveolin. Thus, filipin inhibition correlated more closely with alterations in the biochemical characteristics of CT-bound membranes due to the interactions of filipin with cholesterol rather than with the expressed levels of caveolin and caveolar structure. Our results indicated that the internalization and activation of CT was dependent on and mediated through cholesterol- and glycolipid-rich microdomains at the plasma membrane rather than through a specific morphological structure and that these glycolipid microdomains have the necessary components required to mediate endocytosis.", "date": "1998", "authors": ["Palmer A.

The method combines Taqman technology (Roche) and the ABI Prism 7700 (Perkin Elmer) real-time sequence detection system. We have optimized a single-tube reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) that contains a dual-labeled fluorogenic probe to quantify the 5\u2032 noncoding region (5\u2032 NCR) of HCV. The probe contains a fluorescent reporter at the 5\u2032 end and a fluorescent quencher at the 3\u2032 end. The use of such a probe combined with the 5\u2032-3\u2032 nuclease activity of Taq polymerase allows direct quantitation of the PCR product by the detection of a fluorescent reporter released in the course of the exponential phase of the PCR. For accurate quantitation of the number of copies of HCV in samples containing unknown quantities, we have used serial dilutions of a synthetic 5\u2032 NCR RNA standard of HCV that was previously quantified with an isotopic tracer. The method has a 5-log dynamic range (103 to 107). The coefficient of regression of the standard curve was, on average, 0.98. The intra-assay and the interassay coefficients of variation of the threshold cycle were 1% and 6.2%, respectively. Seventy-nine RNA samples from the sera of infected patients were quantified by this method. Comparison of the results with those obtained by other quantitation methods (the Quantiplex 2.0 branched-DNA assay and the Superquant assay from the National Genetics Institute) revealed a significant correlation with all of the results. The mean values were also statistically comparable. In conclusion, the high sensitivity, simplicity, and reproducibility of the real-time HCV RNA quantitation which allows the screening of large numbers of samples, combined with its wide dynamic range, make this method especially suitable for monitoring of the viral load during therapy and tailoring of treatment schedules.", "date": "1999", "authors": ["Mar\u00eda Martell , Jordi G\u00f3mez , Juan I.

The patients' ages ranged from 44 to 80 years, with a median age of 68 years. The disease has an acute onset. In many respects, the clinical presentation is suggestive of malignant lymphoma. Generalized lymphadenopathy was always present. Hepatomegaly was found in 20 patients, splenomegaly in 17, constitutional symptoms in 20 and skin rashes in nine. Twenty patients had anemia, with positive Coombs' test in eight of 14 tested. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia was found in 17 of 22 patients. Two patterns of evolution were recognizable: (1) long survival (24 to 67 months) without treatment or after the administration of intensive combination chemotherapy; and (2) rapid progression (one to 19 months) regardless of the treatment given. Sixteen patients died; postmortem examination in 10 cases showed the cause of death to be attributable to severe infection in eight patients, to renal disease in one and to cardiovascular disease in one. No evidence of malignant lymphoma was seen in any of these autopsies. Histologically, the disease is systemic, with specific lesions in the lymph nodes. The spleen, liver, bone marrow, skin and lung are also involved, but the changes are less characteristic than in the lymph nodes. In the patients in whom sequential biopsies were performed, a trend toward restoration of the nodal architecture was observed. AILD is a clinical-pathologic entity in a spectrum of yet to be defined immune reactions.

David Tilman focuses on the universal requirement of terrestrial plants for both below-ground and above-ground resources. The physical separation of these resources means that plants face an unavoidable tradeoff. To obtain a higher proportion of one resource, a plant must allocate more of its growth to the structures involved in its acquisition, and thus necessarily obtain a lower proportion of another resource. Professor Tilman presents a simple theory that includes this constraint and tradeoff, and uses the theory to explore the evolution of plant life histories and morphologies along productivity and disturbance gradients. The book shows that relative growth rate, which is predicted to be strongly influenced by a plant's proportional allocation to leaves, is a major determinant of the transient dynamics of competition.

Cordyceps was characterized by the production of well- developed often stipitate stromata and an ecology as a pathogen of arthropods and Elaphomyces with infrageneric classifications emphasizing arrangement of perithecia, ascospore morphology and host affiliation. To refine the classification of Cordyceps and the Clavicipitaceae, the phylogenetic relationships of 162 taxa were estimated based on analyses consisting of five to seven loci, including the nuclear ribosomal small and large subunits (nrSSU and nrLSU), the elongation factor 1\u03b1 (tef1), the largest and the second largest subunits of RNA polymerase \u0406\u0406 (rpb1 and rpb2), \u03b2-tubulin (tub), and mitochondrial ATP6 (atp6). Our results strongly support the existence of three clavicipitaceous clades and reject the monophyly of both Cordyceps and Clavicipitaceae. Most diagnostic characters used in current classifications of Cordyceps (e.g., arrangement of perithecia, ascospore fragmentation, etc.) were not supported as being phylogenetically informative; the characters that were most consistent with the phylogeny were texture, pigmentation and morphology of stromata. Therefore, we revise the taxonomy of Cordyceps and the Clavicipitaceae to be consistent with the multi-gene phylogeny. The family Cordycipitaceae is validated based on the type of Cordyceps, C. militaris, and includes most Cordyceps species that possess brightly coloured, fleshy stromata. The new family Ophiocordycipitaceae is proposed based on Ophiocordyceps Petch, which we emend. The majority of species in this family produce darkly pigmented, tough to pliant stromata that often possess aperithecial apices. The new genus Elaphocordyceps is proposed for a subclade of the Ophiocordycipitaceae, which includes all species of Cordyceps that parasitize the fungal genus Elaphomyces and some closely related species that parasitize arthropods. The family Clavicipitaceae s. s. is emended and includes the core clade of grass symbionts (e.g., Balansia, Claviceps, Epichloe, etc.), and the entomopathogenic genus Hypocrella and relatives. In addition, the new genus Metacordyceps is proposed for Cordyceps species that are closely related to the grass symbionts in the Clavicipitaceae s. s. Metacordyceps includes teleomorphs linked to Metarhizium and other closely related anamorphs. Two new species are described, and lists of accepted names for species in Cordyceps, Elaphocordyceps, Metacordyceps and Ophiocordyceps are provided. & Spatafora, O. aphodii (Mathieson) G.H.

The pattern is shown to be suitable to the formation of alpha helices with an amphipathic character consistent with the formation of a micellar structure, a process entirely appropriate to the protein's known function in the blood stream as a lipid carrier. The simplest hypothesis to account for repeated segments is a series of unequal crossovers. But such a series implies that some segments are more closely related to each other than they are to others, that is, they have a \"phylogenetic\" relationship.

Carry-over contamination from some previous PCR can be a significant problem, due both to the abundance of PCR products, and to the ideal structure of the contaminant material for re-amplification. We report that carry-over contamination can be controlled by the following two steps: (i) incorporating dUTP in all PCR products (by substituting dUPT for dTTP, or by incorporating uracil during synthesis of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers; and (ii) treating all subsequent fully preassembled starting reactions with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), followed by thermal inactivation of UDG. UDG cleaves the uracil base from the phosphodiester backbone of uracil-containing DNA, but has no effect on natural (i.e., thymine-containing) DNA.

In the case of phylogenies, it is argued that the proper method of resampling is to keep all of the original species while sampling characters with replacement, under the assumption that the characters have been independently drawn by the systematist and have evolved independently. Majority-rule consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples.

Existing computer programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples by using weights on the characters, the weight of a character being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling.

They have therefore received widespread attention from policy makers and conservation organizations. Now a common assumption about them \u2014 that humid tropical forests are generally water saturated \u2014 is brought into question. An assessment of species distribution patterns across the Isthmus of Panama shows that drought plays a large role in structuring plant communities in these tropical forests. Changes in soil moisture availability due to climate change and habitat fragmentation are therefore likely to hit tropical species dramatically. Water availability directly shapes local and regional species distributions in tropical forests. This mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping species distributions is critical for improving vegetation\u2013climate models used to project shifts in tropical forest composition, diversity and ecosystem function under changing precipitation patterns associated with past and future global climate change. Although patterns of tree species distributions along environmental gradients have been amply documented in tropical forests1,2,3,4,5,6,7, mechanisms causing these patterns are seldom known. Efforts to evaluate proposed mechanisms have been hampered by a lack of comparative data on species\u2019 reactions to relevant axes of environmental variation1. Here we show that differential drought sensitivity shapes plant distributions in tropical forests at both regional and local scales. Our analyses are based on experimental field assessments of drought sensitivity of 48 species of trees and shrubs, and on their local and regional distributions within a network of 122 inventory sites spanning a rainfall gradient across the Isthmus of Panama. Our results suggest that niche differentiation with respect to soil water availability is a direct determinant of both local- and regional-scale distributions of tropical trees.

This analysis uses a transport model and human permeability results for estimating in vivo drug absorption to illustrate the primary importance of solubility and permeability on drug absorption. The fundamental parameters which define oral drug absorption in humans resulting from this analysis are discussed and used as a basis for this classification scheme. These Biopharmaceutic Drug Classes are defined as: Case 1. High solubility-high permeability drugs, Case 2. Low solubility-high permeability drugs, Case 3. High solubility-low permeability drugs, and Case 4. Low solubility-low permeability drugs. Based on this classification scheme, suggestions are made for setting standards for in vitro drug dissolution testing methodology which will correlate with the in vivo process. This methodology must be based on the physiological and physical chemical properties controlling drug absorption. This analysis points out conditions under which no in vitro-in vivo correlation may be expected e.g. rapidly dissolving low permeability drugs. Furthermore, it is suggested for example that for very rapidly dissolving high solubility drugs, e.g. 85% dissolution in less than 15 minutes, a simple one point dissolution test, is all that may be needed to insure bioavailability. For slowly dissolving drugs a dissolution profile is required with multiple time points in systems which would include low pH, physiological pH, and surfactants and the in vitro conditions should mimic the in vivo processes.

Lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) is a human lymphotropic retrovirus isolated from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or related syndromes, that displays selective tropism for a subset of T lymphocytes defined by the expression of a surface glycoprotein of relative molecular mass 62,000 (62K) termed T4 (refs 6-8). This glycoprotein delineates a subset of T lymphocytes with mainly helper/inducer functions, while T lymphocytes of the reciprocal subset express a glycoprotein termed T8, have mainly cytotoxic/suppressor activities, and are unable to replicate LAV. Such a tropism may be controlled at the genomic level by regulatory sequences, as described for the human T-cell leukaemia viruses HTLV-I and -II (refs 2, 3). Alternatively or concomitantly, productive cell infection may be controlled at the membrane level, requiring the interaction of a specific cellular receptor with the virus envelope, as demonstrated recently for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Therefore, we have investigated whether the T4 molecule itself is related to the receptor for LAV. We report here that preincubation of T4+ lymphocytes with three individual monoclonal antibodies directed at the T4 glycoprotein blocked cell infection by LAV. This blocking effect was specific, as other monoclonal antibodies--such as antibody to histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) class II or anti-T-cell natural killer (TNK) target--directed at other surface structures strongly expressed on activated cultured T4+ cells, did not prevent LAV infection. Direct virus neutralization by monoclonal antibodies was also ruled out.

This polyphasic taxonomy takes into account all available phenotypic and genotypic data and integrates them in a consensus type of classification, framed in a general phylogeny derived from 16S rRNA sequence analysis. In some cases, the consensus classification is a compromise containing a minimum of contradictions. It is thought that the more parameters that will become available in the future, the more polyphasic classification will gain stability. In this review, the practice of polyphasic taxonomy is discussed for four groups of bacteria chosen for their relevance, complexity, or both: the genera Xanthomonas and Campylobacter, the lactic acid bacteria, and the family Comamonadaceae. An evaluation of our present insights, the conclusions derived from it, and the perspectives of polyphasic taxonomy are discussed, emphasizing the keystone role of the species. Taxonomists did not succeed in standardizing species delimitation by using percent DNA hybridization values. Together with the absence of another \"gold standard\" for species definition, this has an enormous repercussion on bacterial taxonomy. This problem is faced in polyphasic taxonomy, which does not depend on a theory, a hypothesis, or a set of rules, presenting a pragmatic approach to a consensus type of taxonomy, integrating all available data maximally. In the future, polyphasic taxonomy will have to cope with (i) enormous amounts of data, (ii) large numbers of strains, and (iii) data fusion (data aggregation), which will demand efficient and centralized data storage. In the future, taxonomic studies will require collaborative efforts by specialized laboratories even more than now is the case.

Previously, most graph AL methods focus on learning node representations from a carefully selected labeled dataset with large amount of unlabeled data neglected. Motivated by the success of contrastive learning (CL), we propose a novel paradigm that seamlessly integrates graph AL with CL. While being able to leverage the power of abundant unlabeled data in a self-supervised manner, nodes selected by AL further provide semantic information that can better guide representation learning. Besides, previous work measures the informativeness of nodes without considering the neighborhood propagation scheme of GNNs, so that noisy nodes may be selected.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) have recently been widely used to model some of the human activities in many areas of science and engineering.

NKSF/IL-12 has multiple effects on T and NK cells and was originally identified and purified from the supernatant fluid of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed human B lymphoblastoid cell lines. We have produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies against both chains of NKSF/IL-12. Some of these antibodies have neutralizing activity, and several combinations of them have been used to establish sensitive radioimmunoassays detecting the free p40 chain, the free p35 chain, or the p70 heterodimer. Using these reagents, we have determined that most EBV-transformed human B lymphoblastoid cell lines constitutively produce low levels of the p70 heterodimer and an excess of the free p40 chain, whereas Burkitt lymphoma-derived, T, myeloid, and many solid tumor-derived cell lines produce neither. Production of both p40 and p70 is increased several-fold upon stimulation of the EBV-transformed cell lines with phorbol diesters. The ability of supernatant fluids from unstimulated and phorbol diester-stimulated cell lines to induce interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production from T and NK cells, one of the effects of NKSF/IL-12, parallels the levels of production of the p70 heterodimer, known to be the biologically active form of NKSF/IL-12. Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain (SAC) and other stimuli induce accumulation of p40 mRNA and production of both p40 and p70 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The producer cells appear to include both adherent cells and nonadherent lymphocytes, possibly B cells. The supernatant fluids from SAC-stimulated PBMC mediate the typical functions of NKSF/IL-12 (i.e., IFN-gamma induction, mitogenic effects on T/NK blasts, enhancement of NK cell cytotoxicity) at concentrations of p70 similar to those at which recombinant NKSF/IL-12 mediates the same functions. Moreover, these activities are significantly inhibited by anti-NKSF/IL-12 antibodies. The neutralizing anti-NKSF/IL-12 antibodies also inhibit 85% of the IFN-gamma production in response to SAC, an NKSF/IL-12 inducer, and approximately 50% of the IFN-gamma production in response to non-NKSF/IL-12-inducers such as IL-2, phytohemagglutinin, and anti-CD3 antibodies. These results indicate that induced or constitutively produced NKSF/IL-12 has a major role in facilitating IFN-gamma production by peripheral blood lymphocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "date": "1992", "authors": ["A D'Andrea , M Rengaraju , N M Valiante , J Chehimi , M Kubin , M Aste , S H Chan , M Kobayashi , D Young , E Nickbarg"], "related_topics": ["Interleukin 12", "Lymphokine-activated killer cell", "Natural killer cell", "Peripheral blood mononuclear cell", "Interferon gamma", "Monoclonal antibody", "Cell culture", "Antibody", "Molecular biology", "Virology", "Biology"], "citation_count": "1,499", "reference_count": "20", "references": ["2100837269", "2102156468", "2119969523", "1561485846", "2095835949", "1977817262", "1605898561", "1829938205", "2101956767", "1634119082"]}, {"id": "2006585942", "title": "DNA polymerases of normal and neoplastic mammalian cells", "abstract": "", "date": "1978", "authors": ["M.G.

Ebola virus (EBOV) infection causes a frequently fatal hemorrhagic fever (HF) that is refractory to treatment with currently available antiviral therapeutics. RNA interference represents a powerful, naturally occurring biological strategy for the inhibition of gene expression and has demonstrated utility in the inhibition of viral replication. Here, we describe the development of a potential therapy for EBOV infection that is based on small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Methods. Four siRNAs targeting the polymerase (L) gene of the Zaire species of EBOV (ZEBOV) were either complexed with polyethylenimine (PEI) or formulated in stable nucleic acid-lipid particles (SNALPs). Guinea pigs were treated with these siRNAs either before or after lethal ZEBOV challenge. Results. Treatment of guinea pigs with a pool of the L gene-specific siRNAs delivered by PEI polyplexes reduced plasma viremia levels and partially protected the animals from death when administered shortly before the ZEBOV challenge. Evaluation of the same pool of siRNAs delivered using SNALPs proved that this system was more efficacious, as it completely protected guinea pigs against viremia and death when administered shortly after the ZEBOV challenge. Additional experiments showed that 1 of the 4 siRNAs alone could completely protect guinea pigs from a lethal ZEBOV challenge. Conclusions. Further development of this technology has the potential to yield effective treatments for EBOV HF as well as for diseases caused by other agents that are considered to be biological threats.", "date": "2006", "authors": ["Thomas W.

The efficiency of RCT depends on the specific ability of apoA-I to promote cellular cholesterol efflux, bind lipids, activate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and form mature HDL that interact with specific receptors and lipid transfer proteins. From the intensive analysis of apoA-I secondary structure has emerged our current understanding of its different classes of amphipathic alpha-helices, which control lipid-binding specificity. The main challenge now is to define apoA-I tertiary structure in its lipid-free and lipid-bound forms. Two models are considered for discoidal lipoproteins formed by association of two apoA-I with phospholipids. In the first or picket fence model, each apoA-I wraps around the disc with antiparallel adjacent alpha-helices and with little intermolecular interactions. In the second or belt model, two antiparallel apoA-I are paired by their C-terminal alpha-helices, wrap around the lipoprotein, and are stabilized by multiple intermolecular interactions. While recent evidence supports the belt model, other models, including hybrid models, cannot be excluded. ApoA-I alpha-helices control lipid binding and association with varying levels of lipids. The N-terminal helix 44-65 and the C-terminal helix 210-241 are recognized as important for the initial association with lipids. In the central domain, helix 100-121 and, to a lesser extent, helix 122-143, are also very important for lipid binding and the formation of mature HDL, whereas helices between residues 144 and 186 contribute little. The LCAT activation domain has now been clearly assigned to helix 144-165 with secondary contribution by helix 166-186. The lower lipid binding affinity of the region 144-186 may be important to the activation mechanism allowing displacement of these apoA-I helices by LCAT and presentation of the lipid substrates. No specific sequence has been found that affects diffusional efflux to lipid-bound apoA-I. In contrast, the C-terminal helices, known to be important for lipid binding and maintenance of HDL in circulation, are also involved in the interaction of lipid-free apoA-I with macrophages and specific lipid efflux. While much progress has been made, other aspects of apoA-I structure-function relationships still need to be studied, particularly its lipoprotein topology and its interaction with other enzymes, lipid transfer proteins and receptors important for HDL metabolism.", "date": "2000", "authors": ["Philippe G.

Background Acute renal failure (ARF) in the critically ill is associated with extremely high mortality rates. Understanding the changing spectrum of ARF will be necessary to facilitate quality improvement efforts and to design successful interventional trials. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study of 618 patients with ARF in intensive care units at five academic medical centers in the United States. Participants were required to sign (or have a proxy sign) informed consent for data collection. A comprehensive data collection instrument captured more than 800 variables, most on a daily basis, throughout the course of ARF. Patient characteristics, dialysis status, and major outcomes were determined and stratified by clinical site. Results The mean age was 59.5 years, 41% were women, and 20% were of minority race or ethnicity. There was extensive comorbidity; 30% had chronic kidney disease, 37% had coronary artery disease, 29% had diabetes mellitus, and 21% had chronic liver disease. Acute renal failure was accompanied by extrarenal organ system failure in most patients, even those who did not require dialysis. Three hundred and ninety-eight (64%) patients required dialysis. The in-hospital mortality rate was 37%, and the rate of mortality or nonrecovery of renal function was 50%. The median hospital length of stay was 25 days (26 days, excluding patients who died). Conclusion There is a changing spectrum of ARF in the critically ill, characterized by a large burden of comorbid disease and extensive extrarenal complications, obligating the need for dialysis in the majority of patients.

Two outbreaks of fulminating haemorrhagic fever occurred in northern Gabon in 1996, with a 70% case-fatality rate. During both outbreaks we identified some individuals in direct contact with sick patients who never developed symptoms. We aimed to determine whether these individuals were indeed infected with Ebola virus, and how they maintained asymptomatic status. Methods Blood was collected from 24 close contacts of symptomatic patients. These asymptomatic individuals were sampled 2, 3, or 4 times during a 1-month period after the first exposure to symptomatic patients. Serum samples were analysed for the presence of Ebola antigens, virus-specific IgM and IgG (by ELISA and western blot), and different cytokines and chemokines. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and reverse-transcriptase-PCR assays were done to amplify RNA of Ebola virus. PCR products were then sequenced. Findings 11 of 24 asymptomatic individuals developed both IgM and IgG responses to Ebola antigens, indicating viral infection. Western-blot analysis showed that IgG responses were directed to nucleoprotein and viral protein of 40 kDa. The glycoprotein and viral protein of 24 kDa genes showed no nucleotide differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Asymptomatic individuals had a strong inflammatory response characterised by high circulating concentrations of cytokines and chemokines. Interpretation This study showed that asymptomatic, replicative Ebola infection can and does occur in human beings. The lack of genetic differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals suggest that asymptomatic Ebola infection did not result from viral mutations.

This novel distance is based on a weighted combination of feature differences between views. We show, through jointly learning per-view weights, that this measure leads to superior classification performance on object category and instance recognition. More importantly, the proposed distance allows us to find a sparse solution via Group-Lasso regularization, where a small subset of representative views of an object is identified and used, with the rest discarded.

Mean age was 66.7 years.Intervention.\u2014Either 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate in 1 tablet daily (n=1380) or a placebo of identical appearance (n=1383). Follow-up averaged 4.1 years; 82% of those assigned to hormone treatment were taking it at the end of 1 year, and 75% at the end of 3 years.Main Outcome Measures.\u2014The primary outcome was the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included coronary revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease. All-cause mortality was also considered.Results.\u2014Overall, there were no significant differences between groups in the primary outcome or in any of the secondary cardiovascular outcomes: 172 women in the hormone group and 176 women in the placebo group had MI or CHD death (relative hazard [RH], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.22). The lack of an overall effect occurred despite a net 11% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and 10% higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in the hormone group compared with the placebo group (each P<.001). Within the overall null effect, there was a statistically significant time trend, with more CHD events in the hormone group than in the placebo group in year 1 and fewer in years 4 and 5. More women in the hormone group than in the placebo group experienced venous thromboembolic events (34 vs 12; RH, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.50-5.58) and gallbladder disease (84 vs 62; RH, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92). There were no significant differences in several other end points for which power was limited, including fracture, cancer, and total mortality (131 vs 123 deaths; RH, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.38).Conclusions.\u2014During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease.

Excluding SSEs, we estimate that 2.7 secondary infections were generated per case on average at the start of the epidemic, with a substantial contribution from hospital transmission. Transmission rates fell during the epidemic, primarily as a result of reductions in population contact rates and improved hospital infection control, but also because of more rapid hospital attendance by symptomatic individuals. As a result, the epidemic is now in decline, although continued vigilance is necessary for this to be maintained.

The performance, i.e., high-resolution ability, accuracy, and convergence rate of the scheme, is assessed in synthetic and real macro- and pico-cellular channels. The results indicate that the scheme overcomes the resolution limitation inherent to classical techniques like the Fourier or beam-forming methods. In particular, it is shown that waves which exhibit an arbitrarily small difference in azimuth can be easily separated as long as their delays or Doppler frequencies differ by a fraction of the intrinsic resolution of the measurement equipment. Two waves are claimed to be separated when the mean-squared estimation errors (MSEEs) of the estimates of their parameters are close to the corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) derived in a scenario where only a single wave is impinging. The adverb easily means that the MSEEs rapidly approach the CLRBs, i.e., within less than 20 iteration cycles. Convergence of the log-likelihood sequence is achieved after approximately ten iteration cycles when the scheme is applied in real channels. In this use, the estimated dominant waves can be related to a scatterer/reflector in the propagation environment.

Infection from CHIKV typically induces a mild disease in humans, characterized by fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. Cases of severe CHIKV infection involving the central nervous system (CNS) have recently been described in neonates as well as in adults with underlying conditions. The pathophysiology of CHIKV infection and the basis for disease severity are unknown. To address these critical issues, we have developed an animal model of CHIKV infection. We show here that whereas wild type (WT) adult mice are resistant to CHIKV infection, WT mouse neonates are susceptible and neonatal disease severity is age-dependent. Adult mice with a partially (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2R+/\u2212) or totally (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212) abrogated type-I IFN pathway develop a mild or severe infection, respectively. In mice with a mild infection, after a burst of viral replication in the liver, CHIKV primarily targets muscle, joint, and skin fibroblasts, a cell and tissue tropism similar to that observed in biopsy samples of CHIKV-infected humans. In case of severe infections, CHIKV also disseminates to other tissues including the CNS, where it specifically targets the choroid plexuses and the leptomeninges. Together, these data indicate that CHIKV-associated symptoms match viral tissue and cell tropisms, and demonstrate that the fibroblast is a predominant target cell of CHIKV. These data also identify the neonatal phase and inefficient type-I IFN signaling as risk factors for severe CHIKV-associated disease.

To investigate the role of this enhancer in regulation of the MLC3F promoter in vivo, we have analyzed reporter gene expression in transgenic mice containing lacZ under transcriptional control of the mouse MLC3F promoter and 3' enhancer element. Our results show that these regulatory elements direct strong expression of lacZ in skeletal muscle; the transgene, however, is activated 4-5 d before the endogenous MLC3F promoter, at the time of initiation of MLC1F transcription. In adult mice, transgene activity is downregulated in muscles that have reduced contributions of type IIB fibers (soleus and diaphragm).

All of these mRNAs, except the lymphotoxin mRNA, lack homology to the TNF mRNAs in the coding region.

Later, the outbreak spread to other parts of the country including Mbarara and Masindi districts. Response measures included surveillance, community mobilization, case and logistics management. Three coordination committees were formed: National Task Force (NTF), a District Task Force (DTF) and an Interministerial Task Force (IMTF). The NTF and DTF were responsible for coordination and follow-up of implementation of activities at the national and district levels, respectively, while the IMTF provided political direction and handled sensitive issues related to stigma, trade, tourism and international relations. The international response was coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO) under the umbrella organization of the Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network. A WHO/CDC case definition for Ebola was adapted and used to capture four categories of cases, namely, the 'alert', 'suspected', 'probable' and 'confirmed cases'. Guidelines for identification and management of cases were developed and disseminated to all persons responsible for surveillance, case management, contact tracing and Information Education Communication (IEC). For the duration of the epidemic that lasted up to 16 January 2001, a total of 425 cases with 224 deaths were reported countrywide. The case fatality rate was 53%. The attack rate (AR) was highest in women. The average AR for Gulu district was 12.6 cases/10 000 inhabitants when the contacts of all cases were considered and was 4.5 cases/10 000 if limited only to contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.

Patients with the same risk factor who were treated for 10 days with intravenous ribavirin, begun within the first 6 days after the onset of fever, had a case-fatality rate of 5 percent (1 of 20) (P = 0.0002 by Fisher's exact test). Patients whose treatment began seven or more days after the onset of fever had a case-fatality rate of 26 percent (11 of 43) (P = 0.01). Viremia with levels greater than or equal to 10(3.6) TCID50 per milliliter on admission was associated with a case-fatality rate of 76 percent (35 of 46). Patients with this risk factor who were treated with intravenous ribavirin within the first six days after onset of fever had a case-fatality rate of 9 percent (1 of 11) (P = 0.006), whereas those treated after seven days or more of illness had a fatality rate of 47 percent (9 of 19) (P = 0.035). Oral ribavirin was also effective in patients at high risk of death. Lassa-convalescent plasma did not significantly reduce mortality in any of the high-risk groups. We conclude that ribavirin is effective in the treatment of Lassa fever and that it should be used at any point in the illness, as well as for postexposure prophylaxis.", "date": "1986", "authors": ["Joseph B Mccormick , I.

To overcome the inherent disadvantage of cost and to improve the diagnostic capacity of the test, multiplex PCR, a variant of the test in which more than one target sequence is amplified using more than one pair of primers, has been developed.

Early studies highlighted the obstacles that can jeopardize the production of sensitive and specific multiplex assays, but more recent studies have provided systematic protocols and technical improvements for simple test design. The most useful of these are the empirical choice of oligonucleotide primers and the use of hot start-based PCR methodology. These advances along with others to enhance sensitivity and specificity and to facilitate automation have resulted in the appearance of numerous publications regarding the application of multiplex PCR in the diagnosis of infectious agents, especially those which target viral nucleic acids.

As the clinical symptoms of MERS tend to be non-specific, the incubation period has been shown to complement differential diagnosis, especially to rule out influenza. However, because an infection event is seldom directly observable, the present study aims to construct a diagnostic model that predicts the probability of MERS diagnosis given the time from immigration to illness onset among imported cases which are suspected of MERS. Addressing censoring by considering the transmission dynamics in an exporting country, we demonstrate that the illness onset within 2 days from immigration is suggestive of influenza. Two exceptions to suspect MERS even for those with illness onset within 2 days since immigration are (i) when we observe substantial community transmissions of MERS and (ii) when the cases are at high risk of MERS (e.g. cases with close contact in hospital or household).

We develop interactive diagnosis algorithms that identify a bug in a program that behaves incorrectly, and implement them in Prolog for the diagnosis of Prolog programs. Their performance suggests that they can be the backbone of debugging aids that go far beyond what is offered by current programming environments. We develop an inductive inference algorithm that synthesizes logic programs from examples of their behavior. The algorithm incorporates the diagnosis algorithms as a component. It is incremental, and progresses by debugging a program with respect to the examples. The Model Inference System is a Prolog implementation of the algorithm. Its range of applications and efficiency is comparable to existing systems for program synthesis from examples and grammatical inference.

IL-10 was detectable 7 h after activation of the monocytes and maximal levels of IL-10 production were observed after 24-48 h. These kinetics indicated that the production of IL-10 by human monocytes was relatively late as compared to the production of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which were all secreted at high levels 4-8 h after activation. The production of IL-10 by LPS activated monocytes was, similar to that of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and G-CSF, inhibited by IL-4. Furthermore we demonstrate here that IL-10, added to monocytes, activated by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), LPS, or combinations of LPS and IFN-gamma at the onset of the cultures, strongly inhibited the production of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF at the transcriptional level. Viral-IL-10, which has similar biological activities on human cells, also inhibited the production of TNF alpha and GM-CSF by monocytes following LPS activation. Activation of monocytes by LPS in the presence of neutralizing anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibodies resulted in the production of higher amounts of cytokines relative to LPS treatment alone, indicating that endogenously produced IL-10 inhibited the production of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha, GM-CSF, and G-CSF. In addition, IL-10 had autoregulatory effects since it strongly inhibited IL-10 mRNA synthesis in LPS activated monocytes. Furthermore, endogenously produced IL-10 was found to be responsible for the reduction in class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression following activation of monocytes with LPS.

Given a set of aligned nucleotide sequences, rpd3 will rapidly analyze these with a range of powerful non-parametric recombination detection methods (including bootscan, maxchi, chimaera, 3seq, geneconv, siscan, phylpro and visrd; Boni et al., 2007; Gibbs et al., 2000; Lemey et al., 2009; Padidam et al., 1999, Posada and Crandall, 2001; Weiller, 1998). It will provide a detailed breakdown of recombination breakpoint locations, and the identities of recombinant and parental sequences. For further downstream analyses, the program enables users to save edited sequence alignments with (i) recombinant sequences removed; (ii) recombinationally derived tracts of sequence removed; or (iii) recombinant sequences split into their constituent parts. An important strength of rdp3 that makes it applicable to a variety of recombination analysis problems is that, unlike many other recombination detection programs such as simplot (Lole et al., 1999), dual brothers (Minin et al., 2005), jphmm (Schultz et al., 2006) or scueal (Kosakovsky et al., 2009), it does not screen predefined sets of potentially recombinant (or query) sequences against other predefined sets of non-recombinant (or reference) sequences. rdp3 instead treats every sequence within an input alignment as a potential recombinant and systematically screens large numbers of sequence triplets and/or quartets to identify sets of three or four sequences that contain a recombinant and two sequences resembling its parents. Such an approach means that rdp3 can simultaneously detect the entire scope of recombination evident within a dataset (i.e. not just that occurring between the reference strains or species) enabling its use in the characterization of complex recombinants such as those derived through recombination between parental sequences that were themselves recombinant. The drawback of such a flexible, exploratory framework is that it can often be difficult to assess the uncertainty associated with inferred recombination patterns. However, with its wide range of cross-checking tools, rpd3 is complementary to probabilistic recombination analysis approaches.", "date": "2010", "authors": ["Darren P.

The purification method, utilizing classical and high-performance liquid chromatographic techniques, yielded protein with a specific activity of 8.5 x 10(7) units/mg in a T-cell growth factor assay. Analysis of the purified protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that CLMF is a 75-kDa heterodimer composed of disulfide-bonded 40-kDa and 35-kDa subunits. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two subunits revealed that both subunits are not related to any previously identified cytokine. Purified CLMF stimulated the proliferation of human phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphoblasts by itself and exerted additive effects when used in combination with suboptimal amounts of interleukin 2.

According to \"neural constructivism,\" the representational features of cortex are built from the dynamic interaction between neural growth mechanisms and environmentally derived neural activity. Contrary to popular selectionist models that emphasize regressive mechanisms, the neurobiological evidence suggests that this growth is a progressive increase in the representational properties of cortex. The interaction between the environment and neural growth results in a flexible type of learning: \"constructive learning\" minimizes the need for prespecification in accordance with recent neurobiological evidence that the developing cerebral cortex is largely free of domain-specific structure. Instead, the representational properties of cortex are built by the nature of the problem domain confronting it. This uniquely powerful and general learning strategy undermines the central assumption of classical learnability theory, that the learning properties of a system can be deduced from a fixed computational architecture. Neural constructivism suggests that the evolutionary emergence of neocortex in mammals is a progression toward more flexible representational structures, in contrast to the popular view of cortical evolution as an increase in innate, specialized circuits. Human cortical postnatal development is also more extensive and protracted than generally supposed, suggesting that cortex has evolved so as to maximize the capacity of environmental structure to shape its structure and function through constructive learning.", "date": "1997", "authors": ["Steven R.

Replication originates within a region of 1077 nucleotides that is 92.8% A+T and lacks any open reading frame larger than 123 nucleotides.

Introns are absent fromD. yakuba mitochondrial genes and there are few (0\u201331) intergenic nucleotides. The genes found inD. yakuba and mammalian mtDNAs are the same, but there are differences in their arrangement and in the relative proportions of the complementary strands of the molecule that serve as templates for transcription. Although theD. yakuba small and large mitochondrial rRNA genes are exceptionally low in G and C and are shorter than any other metazoan rRNA genes reported, they can be folded into secondary structures remarkably similar to the secondary structures proposed for mammalian mitochondrial rRNAs.D. yakuba mitochondrial tRNA genes, like their mammalian counterparts, are more variable in sequence than nonorganelle tRNAs.

Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or \u2018locked in\u2019, with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10\u201325 bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.", "date": "2002", "authors": ["Jonathan R Wolpaw 1, 2, Niels Birbaumer 3, 4, Dennis J McFarland 1, Gert Pfurtscheller 5, Theresa M Vaughan 1"], "related_topics": ["Word processing", "Imagined speech", "Brain\u2013computer interface"], "citation_count": "8,286", "reference_count": "174", "references": ["2132549764", "1583327662", "2153134014", "2116308679", "2145302786", "2140413964", "1543237449", "2168689324", "2079277602", "2093534731"]}, {"id": "1988220558", "title": "DNA probes: applications of the principles of nucleic acid hybridization.", "abstract": "Nucleic acid hybridization with a labeled probe is the only practical way to detect a complementary target sequence in a complex nucleic acid mixture.

The active component that inhibited proliferation at high concentrations of these supernatants appeared to be IFN-gamma based on the following findings: 1) the biphasic pattern of responsiveness correlated with the presence of IFN-gamma in the supernatants; 2) an anti-IFN-gamma mAb augmented the proliferation of D10 cells to these supernatants; 3) rIFN-gamma inhibited profoundly the response of D10 cells stimulated with rIL-1 plus supernatant from activated D10 cells or with rIL-1 plus rIL-4; 4) the response of D10 cells to rIL-1 plus rIL-2 also was inhibited by rIFN-gamma, although to a lesser extent. The proliferation of an additional Th2 clone stimulated with rIL-1 plus rIL-4 or rIL-2 also was inhibited by rIFN-gamma, implicating IFN-gamma as an inhibitory lymphokine for Th2 cells in general. rIFN-gamma did not affect the proliferation of two Th1 clones, nor did it affect the proliferation of an unconventional HTL clone which produces both IL-4 and IFN-gamma and proliferates in response to IL-2 or IL-4 in an IL-1-independent fashion. The proliferation of D10 cells stimulated by Ag or by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody also was blocked by rIFN-gamma, whereas IL-4 production in response to these stimuli was unaffected, indicating that proliferation and not general cell function was specifically inhibited.

However, since the L0 norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly,for certain distributions over the gates, the expected L0 regularized objective is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the hard concrete distribution for the gates, which is obtained by \u201cstretching\u201d a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters.

Statistics calculated from these sequences can be used to give expectations under specific null hypotheses of protein evolution. This Monte Carlo simulation approach to testing hypotheses is often termed 'parametric bootstrapping' (see, for example, Efron, 1985; Huelsenbeck et al., 19%; Huelsenbeck and Rannala, 1997), and has many powerful applications, such as testing the molecular clock (Goldman, 1993), detecting recombination (Grassly and Holmes, 1997), and evaluating competing phylogenetic hypotheses (Hillis et al., 19%). Three common models of amino acid substitution are implemented (PAM: Dayhoff et al., 1978; JTT: Jones et al., 1992; mtREV: Adachi and Hasegawa, 1995). These models use instantaneous rate matrices derived from observed patterns of accepted point mutations for aligned nuclear (PAM, JTT) and mitochondrial (mtREV) genes. The amino acid frequencies found for these alignments are the default in each model, but it is also possible to specify their frequencies independently in the implementation here [following Adachi (1995), but see also Kishino et al. (1990)]. In addition, sitespecific rate heterogeneity following a gamma distribution is allowed (as described in Rambaut and Grassly, 1997; Yang, 1993). As with Seq-Gen, any number of trees may be read in and any number of data sets can be simulated for each tree, allowing large sets of replicate simulations to be created easily. Maximum-likelihood algorithms exist which will reconstruct phylogenies from protein sequences using the PAM, JTT and mtREV substitution models (e.g. Adachi and Hasegawa, 1995; Yang, 1996), and hence bootstrapping to obtain confidence limits about phylogenetic parameters is easily achieved.", "date": "1997", "authors": ["Nicholas C.

Data of 0.94\u2005A resolution for the 237-residue protein concanavalin A are used in unrestrained and restrained full-matrix inversions to provide standard uncertainties \u03c3(r) for positions and \u03c3(l) for bond lengths. \u03c3(r) is as small as 0.01\u2005A for atoms with low Debye B values but increases strongly with B. The results emphasize the distinction between unrestrained and restrained refinements and between \u03c3(r) and \u03c3(l). Other full-matrix inversions are reported. Such inversions require massive calculations. Several approximate methods are examined and compared critically. These include a Fourier map formula [Cruickshank (1949).

Many examples show its usefulness as a precision comparator for high- and low-resolution structures. The effect of restraints as resolution varies is examined. More regular use of full-matrix inversion is urged to establish positional precision and hence the precision of non-dictionary distances in both high- and low-resolution structures.

Studies on the cleavability of the HA of virulent and avirulent H5 viruses showed that the principles established for H7 viruses (F. X. Bosch, M. Orlich, H. D. Klenk, and R. Rott, 1979, Virology 95, 197-207; F. X. Bosch, W. Garten, H. D. Klenk, and R. Rott, 1981, Virology 113, 725-735) also apply to the H5 subtype. These are (1) only the HAs of virulent influenza viruses were cleaved in tissue culture in the absence of trypsin and (2) virulent H5 influenza viruses contain a series of basic amino acids at the cleavage site of the HA, whereas avirulent strains contain only a single arginine with the exception of the avirulent Chicken/Pennsylvania virus. Thus, a series of basic amino acids at the cleavage site probably forms a recognition site for the enzyme(s) responsible for cleavage.", "date": "1987", "authors": ["Yoshihiro Kawaoka 1, Ann Nestorowicz 1, Dennis J.

SETTING Stables in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane. SUBJECTS Affected horses and humans, and at-risk human contacts. RESULTS A pregnant mare died two days after arrival from a paddock elsewhere in Brisbane. Eight to 11 days later, illness (depression, anorexia, fever, dyspnoea, ataxia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and nasal discharge) was reported among 17 other horses from the same or an adjoining stable. Fourteen horses died or were put down. Five and six days after the index mare's death, a stable-hand and then a horse-trainer, both of whom had had close contact with the sick mare's mucous secretions, developed influenza-like illnesses. The stable-hand recovered but the trainer developed pneumonitis, respiratory failure, renal failure and arterial thrombosis, and died from a cardiac arrest seven days after admission to hospital. A morbillivirus cultured from his kidney was identical to one isolated from the lungs of five affected horses. The two affected humans and eight other horses were seropositive for the infection, which was reproduced in healthy horses following challenge by spleen/lung homogenates from infected horses. There was no serological evidence of infection in 157 humans who had had contact with the stables or the sick horses or humans.

MPMV is of obvious importance in that it is the only retrovirus thus far isolated from a mammary tumor of a primate and has been shown to have transforming potential for primate cells in vitro . Subsequent to the isolation of MPMV, viruses morphologically and immunologically indistinguishable from MPMV have been isolated from normal placenta and lactating mammary glands of other rhesus monkeys in captivity. Recently, viruses morphologically resembling MPMV have been isolated from a langur monkey (another Old World monkey) and from squirrel monkeys (a New World monkey).

Furthermore, these viruses also share cross-reactivity of their major external glycoproteins with those of the type C baboon endogenous virus. These interspecies reactivities can also be demonstrated in natural sera from both imported and laboratory-bred monkeys.

Methods The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a retrospective cohort study that tracks the health status of adults who received a diagnosis of childhood cancer between 1970 and 1986 and compares the results with those of siblings. We calculated the frequencies of chronic conditions in 10,397 survivors and 3034 siblings. A severity score (grades 1 through 4, ranging from mild to life-threatening or disabling) was assigned to each condition. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios, reported as relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for a chronic condition. Results Survivors and siblings had mean ages of 26.6 years (range, 18.0 to 48.0) and 29.2 years (range, 18.0 to 56.0), respectively, at the time of the study. Among 10,397 survivors, 62.3% had at least one chronic condition; 27.5% had a severe or life-threatening condition (grade 3 or 4).

In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Five are less than twice the size of the Earth. Over 74% of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases, are 6% for Earth-size candidates, 7% for super-Earth size candidates, 17% for Neptune-size candidates, and 4% for Jupiter-size candidates. Multi-candidate, transiting systems are frequent; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 33.9% of all the candidates are part of multi-candidate systems.", "date": "2011", "authors": ["William J.

Specific suppression owes its activity to the effects of individual or select groups of microorganisms and is transferable. The microbial basis of specific suppression to four diseases, Fusarium wilts, potato scab, apple replant disease, and take-all, is discussed. One of the best-described examples occurs in take-all decline soils. In Washington State, take-all decline results from the buildup of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. that produce the antifungal metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol.

In this profile, the first approximately 30-50 codons are, on average, translated with a low efficiency. Additionally, in eukaryotes, the last approximately 50 codons show the highest efficiency over the full coding sequence. The profile accurately predicts position-dependent ribosomal density along yeast genes. These data suggest that translation speed and, as a consequence, ribosomal density are encoded by coding sequences and the tRNA pool. We suggest that the slow \"ramp\" at the beginning of mRNAs serves as a late stage of translation initiation, forming an optimal and robust means to reduce ribosomal traffic jams, thus minimizing the cost of protein expression.", "date": "2010", "authors": ["Tamir Tuller 1, Asaf Carmi 1, Kalin Vestsigian 2, Sivan Navon 1, Yuval Dorfan 1, John Zaborske 3, Tao Pan 3, Orna Dahan 1, Itay Furman 1, Yitzhak Pilpel 1"], "related_topics": ["Eukaryotic translation", "Translation (biology)", "Transfer RNA", "Coding region", "Ribosomal RNA", "Gene", "Protein biosynthesis", "RNA", "Computational biology", "Genetics", "Biology"], "citation_count": "765", "reference_count": "48", "references": ["2165011536", "2149429041", "2024991751", "2079517684", "2013947447", "2058864686", "2051242197", "2029873987", "2145825942", "1869516088"]}, {"id": "2118492507", "title": "Experimental observation of the quantum Hall effect and Berry's phase in graphene", "abstract": "When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system.

This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron\u2013hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality1,2. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted3,4,5 theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction\u2014a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure6,7.

While there have been some successful object and pattern detection systems in the past, most such systems handle only specific rigid objects or patterns that can be accurately described by fixed geometric models or pictorial templates. This thesis presents a learning based approach for detecting classes of objects and patterns with variable image appearance but highly predictable image boundaries. Some examples of such object and pattern classes include human faces, aerial views of structured terrain features like volcanoes, localized material defect signatures in industrial parts, certain tissue anomalies in medical images, and instances of a given digit or character, which may be written or printed in many different styles. The thesis consists of two parts. In part one, we introduce our object and pattern detection approach using a concrete human face detection example. The approach first builds a distribution-based model of the target pattern class in an appropriate feature space to describe the target's variable image appearance. It then learns from examples a similarity measure for matching new patterns against the distribution-based target model. We also discuss some pertinent learning issues, including ideas on virtual example generation and example selection. The approach makes few assumptions about the target pattern class and should therefore be fairly general, as long as the target class has predictable image boundaries. We show that this is indeed the case by demonstrating the technique on two other pattern detection/recognition problems. Because our object and pattern detection approach is very much learning-based, how well a system eventually performs depends heavily on the quality of training examples it receives. The second part of this thesis looks at how one can select high quality examples for function approximation learning tasks. Active learning is an area of research that investigates how a learner can intelligently select future training examples to get better approximation results with less data. We propose an active learning formulation for function approximation, and show for three specific approximation function classes, that the active example selection strategy learns its target with fewer data samples than random sampling. Finally, we simplify the original active learning formulation, and show how it leads to a tractable example selection paradigm, suitable for use in many object and pattern detection problems.

Even after recovery, the virus remains in body fluids, including semen.1 The years of civil unrest in Sierra Leone (1991-2002) halted the investigation (through international collaboration) of Lassa fever at a specialist unit in Kenema.

Pax7-nGFP Hi can give rise to Pax7-nGFP Lo cells after serial transplantations. Proliferating Pax7-nGFP Hi cells exhibit lower metabolic activity, and the majority performs asymmetric DNA segregation during cell division, wherein daughter cells retaining template DNA strands express stem cell markers. Using chromosome orientation-fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that all chromatids segregate asymmetrically, whereas Pax7-nGFP Lo cells perform random DNA segregation. Therefore, quiescent Pax7-nGFP Hi cells represent a reversible dormant stem cell state, and during muscle regeneration, Pax7-nGFP Hi cells generate distinct daughter cell fates by asymmetrically segregating template DNA strands to the stem cell.

Self-efficacy and intrinsic value were positively related to cognitive engagement and performance. Regression analyses revealed that, depending on the outcome measure, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and test anxiety emerged as the best predictors of performance. Intrinsic value did not have a direct influence on performance but was strongly related to self-regulation and cognitive strategy use, regardless of prior achievement level.

Self-regulation of cognition and behavior is an important aspect of student learning and academic performance in the classroom context (Corno & Mandinach, 1983; Corno & Rohrkemper, 1985).

Two regimes are identified in which the network is susceptible to very large cascades\u2014herein called global cascades\u2014that occur very rarely. When cascade propagation is limited by the connectivity of the network, a power law distribution of cascade sizes is observed, analogous to the cluster size distribution in standard percolation theory and avalanches in self-organized criticality. But when the network is highly connected, cascade propagation is limited instead by the local stability of the nodes themselves, and the size distribution of cascades is bimodal, implying a more extreme kind of instability that is correspondingly harder to anticipate. In the first regime, where the distribution of network neighbors is highly skewed, it is found that the most connected nodes are far more likely than average nodes to trigger cascades, but not in the second regime.

The use of a short-term transfection assay, in which expression vectors for one or a combination of these gadd/MyD genes were transfected with a selectable marker into several different human tumor cell lines, provided direct evidence for the growth-inhibitory functions of the products of these genes and their ability to synergistically suppress growth.

Type I interferon (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) is secreted by virus-infected cells. Immune, type II, or gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) is secreted by thymus-derived (T) cells under certain conditions of activation and by natural killer (NK) cells. Although originally defined as an agent with direct antiviral activity, the properties of IFN-gamma include regulation of several aspects of the immune response, stimulation of bactericidal activity of phagocytes, stimulation of antigen presentation through class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, orchestration of leukocyte-endothelium interactions, effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as the stimulation and repression of a variety of genes whose functional significance remains obscure. The implementation of such a variety of effects by a single cytokine is achieved by complex patterns of cell-specific gene regulation: Several IFN-gamma-regulated genes are themselves components of transcription factors. The IFN-gamma response is itself regulated by interaction with responses to other cytokines including IFN-alpha/beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-4. Over 200 genes are now known to be regulated by IFN-gamma and they are listed in a World Wide Web document that accompanies this review. However, much of the cellular response to IFN-gamma can be described in terms of a set of integrated molecular programs underlying well-defined physiological systems, for example the induction of efficient antigen processing for MHC-mediated antigen presentation, which play clearly defined roles in pathogen resistance. A promising approach to the complexity of the IFN-gamma response is to extend the analysis of the less understood IFN-gamma-regulated genes in terms of molecular programs functional in pathogen resistance.", "date": "1996", "authors": ["U Boehm , T Klamp , M Groot , J C Howard"], "related_topics": ["Antigen presentation", "Antigen processing", "Major histocompatibility complex", "Antigen", "Interferon", "Immune system", "Interferon gamma", "Cytokine", "Cell biology", "Immunology", "Biology"], "citation_count": "4,562", "reference_count": "282", "references": ["2166781237", "2029275361", "2172466148", "2042626190", "1834041853", "2140066663", "1780460389", "2108473659", "2173560213", "2142541950"]}, {"id": "2132822703", "title": "Computed radiography utilizing scanning laser stimulated luminescence", "abstract": "A new system of computed radiography that is based on new concepts and the latest computer technologies has been developed.

In this paper we ask whether leaf life\u2014span is related to other leaf, plant, and stand traits of species from diverse ecosystems and biomes. We also examine the interaction between leaf, plant, and stand traits and their relation to productivity and ecological patterns. Among all species, both mass\u2014 (Amass) and area\u2014based (Aarea) maximum net photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf life\u2014span, but the relationship was stronger on a mass (P .25, r2 = 0.01). Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) and leaf diffusive conductance also decreased with increasing leaf life\u2014span. Decreasing Amass with increasing leaf life\u2014span results from the impact of decreasing Nmass and SLA on Amass. Variation in leaf traits as a function of leaf life\u2014span was similar for broad\u2014leaved and needle\u2014leaved subsets of the data. These leaf\u2014scale data from several biomes were compared to a data set from a single biome, Amazonia. For several leaf traits (e.g., SLA, Nmass, and Amass) the quantitative relationship with leaf life\u2014span was similar in the two independent data sets, suggesting that these are fundamental relations applicable to all species. Amass was a linear function of Nmass (P .001, r2 = 0.74) with a regression similar to previous analyses, while Aarea was not significantly related to Narea. These results suggest that the photosynthesis\u2014leaf N relationship among species should be considered universal when expressed on a mass, but not on a leaf area, basis. Relative growth rates (RGR) and leaf area ratio (LAR, the whole\u2014plant ratio of leaf area to total dry mass) of seedlings decreased with increasing leaf life\u2014span (P < .001, r2 = 0.61 and 0.89, respectively). LAR was positively related to both RGR and Amass (r2 = 0.68 and 0.84, respectively), and Amass and RGR were also positively related (r2 = 0.55). Absolute height growth rates of young trees decreased with increasing leaf life\u2014span (P < .001, r2 = 0.72) and increased with Amass (P < .001, r2 = 0.78). It appears that a suite of traits including short leaf life\u2014span and high leaf Nmass, SLA, LAR, and Amass interactively contribute to high growth rates in open\u2014grown individuals. These traits interact similarly at the stand level, but stands differ from individuals in one key trait. In closed\u2014canopy forests, species with longer lived foliage (and low LAR as seedlings) have greater foliage mass per unit ground area (P < .001, r2 = 0.74) and a greater proportion of total mass in foliage. The aboveground production efficiency (ANPP/foliar biomass) of forest stands decreased markedly with increasing leaf life\u2014span or total foliage mass (P < .001, r2 = 0.78 and 0.72, respectively), probably as a result of decreasing Amass, Nmass, and SLA, all of which were positively related with production efficiency and negatively related to total foliage mass. However, high foliage mass of species with extended leaf life\u2014spans appears to compensate for low production per unit foliage, since aboveground net primary production (ANPP, in megagrams per hectare per year) of forest stands was not related to leaf life\u2014span. Extended leaf life\u2014span also appears to compensate for lower potential production per unit leaf N per unit time, with the result that stand\u2014level N use efficiency is weakly positively related to leaf life\u2014span. We hypothesize that co\u2014variation among species in leaf life\u2014span, SLA, leaf Nmass, Amass, and growth rate reflects a set of mutually supporting traits that interact to determine plant behavior and production, and provide a useful conceptual link between processes at short\u2014term leaf scales and longer term whole plant and stand\u2014level scales. Although this paper has focused on leaf life\u2014span, this trait is so closely interrelated with several others that this cohort of leaf traits should be viewed as casually interrelated. Generality in the relationships between leaf life\u2014span and other plant traits across diverse communities and ecosystems suggests that they are universal in nature and thus can provide a quantitative link and/or common currency for ecological comparisons among diverse systems.", "date": "1992", "authors": ["Peter B Reich 1, M B Walters 1, D S Ellsworth 2"], "related_topics": ["Specific leaf area", "Biomass (ecology)", "Ecosystem"], "citation_count": "1,791", "reference_count": "0", "references": ["2118295263", "2101020813", "2127928904", "2144042033", "2167109558", "2168173042", "1951371090", "2119567434", "2031418293", "2153478495"]}, {"id": "2120898255", "title": "On the performance of random vector quantization limited feedback beamforming in a MISO system", "abstract": "In multiple antenna wireless systems, beamforming is a simple technique for guarding against the negative effects of fading.

Cost-effectiveness comparisons of the various diagnostic options have not been presented. Methods and Findings We compared cost-effectiveness, as measured by cost per life-years gained and proportion of patients successfully diagnosed and treated, of 33 PCP diagnostic options, involving combinations of specimen collection methods [oral washes, induced and expectorated sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)] and laboratory diagnostic procedures [various staining procedures or polymerase chain reactions (PCR)], or clinical diagnosis with chest x-ray alone. Our analyses were conducted from the perspective of the government payer among ambulatory, HIV-infected patients with symptoms of pneumonia presenting to HIV clinics and hospitals in South Africa. Costing data were obtained from the National Institutes of Communicable Diseases in South Africa. At 50% disease prevalence, diagnostic procedures involving expectorated sputum with any PCR method, or induced sputum with nested or real-time PCR, were all highly cost-effective, successfully treating 77\u201390% of patients at $26\u201351 per life-year gained. Procedures using BAL specimens were significantly more expensive without added benefit, successfully treating 68\u201390% of patients at costs of $189\u2013232 per life-year gained.

It has been reported that the EBOV genome variation might have an effect on the efficacy of sequence-based virus detection and candidate therapeutics.

We present an algorithm that has the same space and time complexity as the classical Needleman-Wunsch algorithm while accommodating sequencing errors and other biological deviations from the coding frame.

We did not use information about cDNA/EST in most predictions to model a real situation for finding new genes because information about complete cDNA is often absent or based on very small partial fragments. We investigated the accuracy of gene prediction on different levels and designed several schemes to predict an unambiguous set of genes (annotation CGG1), a set of reliable exons (annotation CGG2), and the most complete set of exons (annotation CGG3). For 49 genes, protein products of which have clear homologs in protein databases, predictions were recomputed by Fgenesh+ program. The first annotation serves as the optimal computational description of new sequence to be presented in a database. Reliable exons from the second annotation serve as good candidates for selecting the PCR primers for experimental work for gene structure verification. Our results shows that we can identify approximately 90% of coding nucleotides with 20% false positives. At the exon level we accurately predicted 65% of exons and 89% including overlapping exons with 49% false positives. Optimizing accuracy of prediction, we designed a gene identification scheme using Fgenesh, which provided sensitivity (Sn) = 98% and specificity (Sp) = 86% at the base level, Sn = 81% (97% including overlapping exons) and Sp = 58% at the exon level and Sn = 72% and Sp = 39% at the gene level (estimating sensitivity on std1 set and specificity on std3 set). In general, these results showed that computational gene prediction can be a reliable tool for annotating new genomic sequences, giving accurate information on 90% of coding sequences with 14% false positives. However, exact gene prediction (especially at the gene level) needs additional improvement using gene prediction algorithms. The program was also tested for predicting genes of human Chromosome 22 (the last variant of Fgenesh can analyze the whole chromosome sequence).

Design: Prospective, multicenter, observational cohort analysis. Setting: Forty ICUs in 16 countries. Patients: All patients admitted to one of the participating ICUs in May 1995, except those who stayed in the ICU for less than 48 h after uncomplicated surgery, were included. After the exclusion of 38 patients with a history of chronic renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, a total of 1411 patients were studied. Measurements and results: Of the patients, 348 (24.7 %) developed ARF, as diagnosed by a serum creatinine of 300 \u03bcmol/l (3.5 mg/dl) or more and/or a urine output of less than 500 ml/day. The most important risk factors for the development of ARF present on admission were acute circulatory or respiratory failure; age more than 65 years, presence of infection, past history of chronic heart failure (CHF), lymphoma or leukemia, or cirrhosis. ARF patients developed MOF earlier than non-ARF patients (median 24 vs 48 h after ICU admission, p < 0.05). ARF patients older than 65 years with a past history of CHF or with any organ failure on admission were most likely to develop MOF. ICU mortality was 3 times higher in ARF than in other patients (42.8 % vs 14.0 %, p < 0.01). Oliguric ARF was an independent risk factor for overall mortality as determined by a multivariate regression analysis (OR = 1.59 [CI 95 %: 1.23\u20132.06], p < 0.01). Infection increased the risk of death associated with all factors. Factors that increased the ICU mortality of ARF patients were a past history of hematologic malignancy, age more than 65 years, the number of failing organs on admission and the presence of acute cardiovascular failure. Conclusion: In ICU patients, the most important risk factors for ARF or mortality from ARF are often present on admission. During the ICU stay, other organ failures (especially cardiovascular) are important risk factors.

However, in subtype A infected individuals from a sex worker cohort and subtype B individuals from STD clinics, infection was frequently established by multiple variants. This study examined over 1750 single-genome amplified viral sequences derived from epidemiologically linked subtype C and subtype A transmission pairs very early after infection. In 90% (18/20) of the pairs, HIV-1 infection is initiated by a single viral variant that is derived from the quasispecies of the transmitting partner. In addition, the virus initiating infection in individuals who were infected by someone other than their spouse was characterized to determine if genital infections mitigated the severe genetic bottleneck observed in a majority of epidemiologically linked heterosexual HIV-1 transmission events. In nearly 50% (3/7) of individuals infected by someone other than their spouse, multiple genetic variants from a single individual established infection. A statistically significant association was observed between infection by multiple genetic variants and an inflammatory genital infection in the newly infected individual. Thus, in the vast majority of HIV-1 transmission events in cohabiting heterosexual couples, a single genetic variant establishes infection.

Although the virus has a wide geographic distribution, most of the known vectors are sylvatic Aedes mosquitoes from Africa where the virus was first isolated. Presently, Ae. aegypti is the only known vector to transmit the virus outside the African continent, though Ae. albopictus has long been a suspected vector. Currently, Ae. albopictus has been shown capable of transmitting more than 20 arboviruses and its notoriety as an important vector came to light during the recent chikungunya pandemic. The vulnerability of Singapore to emerging infectious arboviruses has stimulated our interest to determine the competence of local Ae. albopictus to transmit ZIKV. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine the competence of Ae. albopictus to ZIKV, we orally infected local mosquito strains to a Ugandan strain virus. Fully engorged mosquitoes were maintained in an environmental chamber set at 29\u00b0C and 80\u201385%RH. Twelve mosquitoes were then sampled daily from day one to seven and on day 10 and 14 post infection (pi). Zika virus titre in the midgut and salivary glands of each mosquito were determined using tissue culture infectious dose50 assay, while transmissibility of the virus was determined by detecting viral antigen in the mosquito saliva by qRT-PCR. High dissemination and transmission rate of ZIKV were observed. By day 7-pi, all mosquitoes have disseminated infection and 73% of these mosquitoes have ZIKV in their saliva. By day 10-pi, all mosquitoes were potentially infectious. Conclusions/Significance The study highlighted the potential of Ae. albopictus to transmit ZIKV and the possibility that the virus could be established locally.

Previous studies indicated that human infections with adenoviruses are self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts with evidence of some persistence in adenoid tissue. We sought to better understand the natural history of adenovirus infections in various non-human primates and discovered that healthy populations of great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) and macaques shed substantial quantities of infectious adenoviruses in stool. Shedding in stools from asymptomatic humans was found to be much less frequent, comparable to frequencies reported before. We purified and fully sequenced 30 novel adenoviruses from apes and 3 novel adenoviruses from macaques. Analyses of the new ape adenovirus sequences (as well as the 4 chimpanzee adenovirus sequences we have previously reported) together with 22 complete adenovirus genomes available from GenBank revealed that (a) the ape adenoviruses could clearly be classified into species corresponding to human adenovirus species B, C, and E, (b) there was evidence for intraspecies recombination between adenoviruses, and (c) the high degree of phylogenetic relatedness of adenoviruses across their various primate hosts provided evidence for cross species transmission events to have occurred in the natural history of B and E viruses. The high degree of asymptomatic shedding of live adenovirus in non-human primates and evidence for zoonotic transmissions warrants caution for primate handling and housing.

These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein\u2019s theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.", "date": "2009", "authors": ["Hugo Touchette"], "related_topics": ["Statistical theory", "Statistical mechanics", "Large deviations theory"], "citation_count": "2,008", "reference_count": "271", "references": []}, {"id": "2107229793", "title": "Using natural means to reduce surface transport noise during propagation outdoors", "abstract": "This paper reviews ways of reducing surface transport noise by natural means.

For instance, unobserved confounding factors threaten the internal validity of estimates, data availability is often limited to non-random, selection-biased samples, causal effects need to be learned from surrogate experiments with imperfect compliance, and causal knowledge has to be extrapolated across structurally heterogeneous populations. A powerful causal inference framework is required to tackle these challenges, which plague most data analysis to varying degrees. Building on the structural approach to causality introduced by Haavelmo (1943) and the graph-theoretic framework proposed by Pearl (1995), the artificial intelligence (AI) literature has developed a wide array of techniques for causal learning that allow to leverage information from various imperfect, heterogeneous, and biased data sources (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016). In this paper, we discuss recent advances in this literature that have the potential to contribute to econometric methodology along three dimensions. First, they provide a unified and comprehensive framework for causal inference, in which the aforementioned problems can be addressed in full generality. Second, due to their origin in AI, they come together with sound, efficient, and complete algorithmic criteria for automatization of the corresponding identification task.

Since the effects of PEEP probably depend on the recruitability of lung tissue, we conducted a study to examine the relationship between the percentage of potentially recruitable lung, as indicated by computed tomography (CT), and the clinical and physiological effects of PEEP. Methods Sixty-eight patients with acute lung injury or ARDS underwent whole-lung CT during breath-holding sessions at airway pressures of 5, 15, and 45 cm of water. The percentage of potentially recruitable lung was defined as the proportion of lung tissue in which aeration was restored at airway pressures between 5 and 45 cm of water. Results The percentage of potentially recruitable lung varied widely in the population, accounting for a mean (\u00b1SD) of 13\u00b111 percent of the lung weight, and was highly correlated with the percentage of lung tissue in which aeration was maintained after the application of PEEP (r 2 = 0.72, P<0.001). On average, 24 percent of the lung could not be recruited. Patients with a higher percentage of potentially recruitable lung (greater than the median value of 9 percent) had greater total lung weights (P<0.001), poorer oxygenation (defined as a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen) (P<0.001) and respiratory-system compliance (P = 0.002), higher levels of dead space (P = 0.002), and higher rates of death (P = 0.02) than patients with a lower percentage of potentially recruitable lung. The combined physiological variables predicted, with a sensitivity of 71 percent and a specificity of 59 percent, whether a patient\u2019s proportion of potentially recruitable lung was higher or lower than the median.

In this review, we identify four fundamental mechanisms that cause edge responses: ecological flows, access to spatially separated resources, resource mapping, and species interactions. We present a conceptual framework that identifies the pathways through which these four mechanisms can influence distributions, ultimately leading to new ecological communities near habitat edges. Next, we examine a predictive model of edge responses and show how it can explain much of the variation reported in the literature. Using this model, we show that, when observed, edge responses are largely predictable and consistent. When edge responses are variable for the same species ...", "date": "2004", "authors": ["Leslie Ries 1, Robert J. Fletcher 2, James Battin 1, Thomas D.

To address the challenge of rapidly identifying clinical research priorities in those circumstances, we developed and piloted a protocol for carrying out a systematic, rapid research needs appraisal (RRNA) of existing evidence within 5\u2009days in response to outbreaks globally, with the aim to inform clinical research prioritization. The protocol was derived from rapid review methodologies and optimized through effective use of pre-defined templates and global time zones. It was piloted using a Lassa fever (LF) outbreak scenario. Databases were searched from 1969 to July 2017. Systematic reviewers based in Canada, the UK, and the Philippines screened and extracted data using a systematic review software. The pilot was evaluated through internal analysis and by comparing the research priorities identified from the data, with those identified by an external LF expert panel. The RRNA pilot was completed within 5\u2009days. To accommodate the high number of articles identified, data extraction was prioritized by study design and year, and the clinical research prioritization done post-day 5. Of 118 potentially eligible articles, 52 met the data extraction criteria, of which 46 were extracted within the 5-day time frame. The RRNA team identified 19 clinical research priorities; the expert panel independently identified 21, of which 11 priorities overlapped. Each method identified a unique set of priorities, showing that combining both methods for clinical research prioritization is more robust than using either method alone. This pilot study shows that it is feasible to carry out a systematic RRNA within 5\u2009days in response to a (re-) emerging outbreak to identify gaps in existing evidence, as long as sufficient resources are identified, and reviewers are experienced and trained in advance. Use of an online systematic review software and global time zones effectively optimized resources. Another 3 to 5\u2009days are recommended for review of the extracted data and to formulate clinical research priorities.

This paper describes experimental tests with deaf subjects that compared the most effective known methods of creating extremely compressed ASL images. The minimum requirements for intelligibility were determined for three basically different kinds of transformations: (1) gray-scale transformations that subsample the images in space and time; (2) two-level intensity quantization that converts the gray scale image into a black-and-white approximation; (3) transformations that convert the images into black and white outline drawings (cartoons). In Experiment 1, five subjects made quality ratings of 81 kinds of images that varied in spatial resolution, frame rate, and type of transformation. The most promising image size was 96 \u00d7 64 pixels (height \u00d7 width). The 17 most promising image transformations were selected for formal intelligibility testing: 38 deaf subjects viewed 87 ASL sequences 1\u20132 s long of each transformation. The most effective code for gray-scale images is an analog raster code, which can produce images with 0.86 normalized intelligibility (I) at a bandwidth of 2,880 Hz and therefore is transmittable on ordinary 3 KHz telephone circuits. For the binary images, a number of coding schemes are described and compared, the most efficient being an extension of the quadtree method, here termed binquad coding which yielded I = 0.68 at 7,500 bits per second (bps). For cartoons, an even more efficient polygonal transformation with a victorgraph code yielding, for connected straight line segments, is proposed, together with a vectorgraph code yielding, for example, I = 0.56 at 3,900 bps and I = 0.70 at 6,000 bps.

Studies of a few unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is used and stored. Here we characterize the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person's gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable 'core microbiome' at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiological states (obese compared with lean).", "date": "2009", "authors": ["Peter J.

It argues that such studies are bringing together two previous paths of progress in evolutionary biology. One path is that of those who worked far above the species level and were concerned with genealogical trees, time scales and the accumulation of new mutations on surviving molecular lineages. The other path is that of those who worked at and below the species level and were concerned mainly with population structure, migration and the frequencies of alleles that existed in an ancestral population. This fusion of paths is made possible by the high rate at which mutations accumulate on mtDNA lineages and by this molecule's uniparental and apparently haploid mode of inheritance. These properties make mtDNA a superb tool for building trees and time scales relating molecular lineages at and below the species level. In addition, owing to its mode of inheritance, mtDNA is more sensitive to bottlenecks in population size and to population subdivision than are nuclear genes. Joint comparative studies of both mtDNA and nuclear DNA variability give us valuable insights into how effective population size has varied through time.

Stomatal conductance, the process that governs plant water use and carbon uptake, is fundamental to such models. In this paper, we reconcile two long-standing theories of stomatal conductance. The empirical approach, which is most commonly used in vegetation models, is phenomenological, based on experimental observations of stomatal behaviour in response to environmental conditions. The optimal approach is based on the theoretical argument that stomata should act to minimize the amount of water used per unit carbon gained. We reconcile these two approaches by showing that the theory of optimal stomatal conductance can be used to derive a model of stomatal conductance that is closely analogous to the empirical models. Consequently, we obtain a unified stomatal model which has a similar form to existing empirical models, but which now provides a theoretical interpretation for model parameter values. The key model parameter, g1 ,i s predicted to increase with growth temperature and with the marginal water cost of carbon gain. The new model is fitted to a range of datasets ranging from tropical to boreal trees. The parameter g1 is shown to vary with growth temperature, as predicted, and also with plant functional type. The model is shown to correctly capture responses of stomatal conductance to changing atmospheric CO2, and thus can be used to test for stomatal acclimation to elevated CO2. The reconciliation of the optimal and empirical approaches to modelling stomatal conductance is important for global change biology because it provides a simple theoretical framework for analyzing, and simulating, the coupling between carbon and water cycles under environmental change.", "date": "2011", "authors": ["Belinda E.

This model is based on the finite element method, but decouples the degrees of freedom by breaking down object motion into rigid and nonrigid vibration or deformation modes. The result is an accurate representation for both rigid and nonrigid motion that has greatly reduced dimensionality, capturing the intuition that nonrigid motion is normally coherent and not chaotic. Because of the small number of parameters involved, this representation is used to obtain accurate overstrained estimates of both rigid and nonrigid global motion. It is also shown that these estimates can be integrated over time by use of an extended Kalman filter, resulting in stable and accurate estimates of both three-dimensional shape and three-dimensional velocity. The formulation is then extended to include constrained nonrigid motion. Examples of tracking single nonrigid objects and multiple constrained objects are presented. >", "date": "1991", "authors": ["A. Pentland , B.

Vaccination is the principal means to combat the impact of influenza. During an influenza pandemic the immune status of the population would differ from that which exists during interpandemic periods. An emerging pandemic virus will create a surge in worldwide vaccine demand and new approaches in immunisation strategies may be needed to ensure optimum protection of unprimed individuals when vaccine antigen may be limited. The manufacture of vaccines from pathogenic avian influenza viruses by traditional methods is not feasible for safety reasons as well as technical issues. Strategies adopted to overcome these issues include the use of reverse genetic systems to generate reassortant strains, the use of baculovirusexpressed haemagglutinin or related non-pathogenic avian influenza strains, and the use of adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity. In clinical trials, conventional surfaceantigen influenza virus vaccines produced from avian viruses have proved poorly immunogenic in immunologically naive populations.

The signaling via the ERK cascade is mediated by sequential phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases in the different tiers of the cascade. Although the main core phosphorylation chain of the cascade includes Raf kinases, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 (ERKs) and RSKs, other alternatively spliced forms and distinct components exist in the different tiers, and participate in ERK signaling under specific conditions. These components enhance the complexity of the ERK cascade and thereby, enable the wide variety of functions that are regulated by it. Another factor that is important for the dissemination of ERKs' signals is the multiplicity of the cascade's substrates, which include transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements, regulators of apoptosis, and a variety of other signaling-related molecules. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs, and the list of these substrates, as well as the function and mechanism of activation of representative substrates, are described in the current review. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis.

They hold promise in tissue targeting applications, controlled drug release and moreover, their interesting nanoscopic architecture might allow easier passage across biological barriers by transcytosis. However, from the vast array of structures currently emerging from synthetic chemistry it is essential to design molecules that have real potential for in vivo biological use. Here, polyamidoamine (PAMAM, Starburst), poly(propyleneimine) with either diaminobutane or diaminoethane as core, and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) grafted carbosilane (CSi-PEO) dendrimers were used to study systematically the effect of dendrimer generation and surface functionality on biological properties in vitro. Generally, dendrimers bearing -NH(2) termini displayed concentration- and in the case of PAMAM dendrimers generation-dependent haemolysis, and changes in red cell morphology were observed after 1 h even at low concentrations (10 microg/ml). At concentrations below 1 mg/ml CSi-PEO dendrimers and those dendrimers with carboxylate (COONa) terminal groups were neither haemolytic nor cytotoxic towards a panel of cell lines in vitro. In general, cationic dendrimers were cytotoxic (72 h incubation), displaying IC(50) values=50-300 microg/ml dependent on dendrimer-type, cell-type and generation. Preliminary studies with polyether dendrimers prepared by the convergent route showed that dendrimers with carboxylate and malonate surfaces were not haemolytic at 1 h, but after 24 h, unlike anionic PAMAM dendrimers they were lytic. Cationic 125I-labelled PAMAM dendrimers (gen 3 and 4) administered intravenously (i.v.) to Wistar rats ( approximately 10 microg/ml) were cleared rapidly from the circulation (<2% recovered dose in blood at 1 h). Anionic PAMAM dendrimers (gen 2.5, 3.5 and 5.5) showed longer circulation times ( approximately 20-40% recovered dose in blood at 1 h) with generation-dependent clearance rates; lower generations circulated longer. For both anionic and cationic species blood levels at 1 h correlated with the extent of liver capture observed (30-90% recovered dose at 1 h). 125I-Labelled PAMAM dendrimers injected intraperitoneally were transferred to the bloodstream within an hour and their subsequent biodistribution mirrored that seen following i.v. injection. Inherent toxicity would suggest it unlikely that higher generation cationic dendrimers will be suitable for parenteral administration, especially if they are to be used at a high dose.

RAR and RXR have a high degree of cooperativity in binding to target DNA, consistent with previous reports indicating that the binding of either RAR or RXR to their cognate response elements is enhanced by factors present in nuclear extracts4,5. RXR also interacts directly with and enhances the binding of nuclear receptors conferring responsiveness to vitamin D3 and thyroid hormone T3; the DNA-binding activities of these receptors are also stimulated by the presence of nuclear extracts6\u20139.

The algorithm is derived from a probability model of the source that generated the text. The fundamental structure of the model is specified abstractly so that the detailed component models of phonology, word-order, and word frequency can be replaced in a modular fashion. The model yields a language-independent, prior probability distribution on all possible sequences of all possible words over a given alphabet, based on the assumption that the input was generated by concatenating words from a fixed but unknown lexicon. The model is unusual in that it treats the generation of a complete corpus, regardless of length, as a single event in the probability space. Accordingly, the algorithm does not estimate a probability distribution on wordss instead, it attempts to calculate the prior probabilities of various word sequences that could underlie the observed text. Experiments on phonemic transcripts of spontaneous speech by parents to young children suggest that our algorithm is more effective than other proposed algorithms, at least when utterance boundaries are given and the text includes a substantial number of short utterances.", "date": "1999", "authors": ["Michael R.

No large-scale studies exist from Nigeria, where the Lassa virus (LASV) is most diverse. LASV diversity, coupled with host genetic and environmental factors, might cause differences in disease pathophysiology. Small-scale studies in Nigeria suggest that acute kidney injury is an important clinical feature and might be a determinant of survival. We aimed to establish the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mortality in Nigerian patients with Lassa fever, and hypothesised that LASV was the direct cause of intrinsic renal damage for a subset of the patients with Lassa fever. Methods We did a retrospective, observational cohort study of consecutive patients in Nigeria with Lassa fever, who tested positive for LASV with RT-PCR, and were treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. We did univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, including logistic regression, of all demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables available at presentation to identify the factors associated with patient mortality. Findings Of 291 patients treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital between Jan 3, 2011, and Dec 11, 2015, 284 (98%) had known outcomes (died or survived) and seven (2%) were discharged against medical advice. Overall case-fatality rate was 24% (68 of 284 patients), with a 1\u00b74 times increase in mortality risk for each 10 years of age (p=0\u00b700017), reaching 39% (22 of 57) for patients older than 50 years. Of 284 patients, 81 (28%) had acute kidney injury and 104 (37%) had CNS manifestations and thus both were considered important complications of acute Lassa fever in Nigeria. Acute kidney injury was strongly associated with poor outcome (case-fatality rate of 60% [49 of 81 patients]; odds ratio [OR] 15, p Interpretation Our study presents detailed clinical and laboratory data for Nigerian patients with Lassa fever and provides strong evidence for intrinsic renal dysfunction in acute Lassa fever. Early recognition and treatment of acute kidney injury might significantly reduce mortality.
